Hey everyone! This is the last video from my Sikkim series and it’s all about Gangtok! Since this was my second time in Gangtok, I tried to cover more off beat places that I hadn’t already seen. In this video, I visited some sightseeing spots like Tashi View Point, Ganeshtok, MG Marg, Enchey Monastery and tried some delicious food at Nor-khill hotel and the cute cafes at MG Marg. We also went on a cable card ride to get an amazing view of Gangtok. This was such a perfect way to end my trip to Sikkim! :)

What an incredible year filled with so many new experiences, adventures, fun, love and lots of learnings! So so grateful to 2022 for being the highlight of my whole life. Also can’t believe I traveled to 16 countries (and some of them multiple times like Switzerland Germany and the US); that’s actually more than the number of countries I’d been to all my life prior to 2022. 🤯 Never imagined I’d live a life like this but thank you for making that happen through your support, it literally means the world to me 🥹❤️
Here’s hoping 2023 is as amazing as 2022 was. Happy New Year everyone! 🥳🫶🏻

Check out my store: https://www.kritikagoelshop.com

Hey everyone! I recently went on a trip to Sikkim with my friend Shumnima (who is from Sikkim). During our trip to Sikkim, we explored Gangtok and the western parts of Sikkim (Pelling and around). Although I’ve been to Sikkim before, this trip was such a different experience, especially since I stayed and explored with a local.

This is the first video in my four part series of Sikkim. In this video, we travel from Mumbai to Bagdogra to Gangtok in Sikkim. We also went to MG Marg in Gangtok and I tried some delicious local Sikkimese food! Keep an eye out for the next part of this series where I explore Pelling and West Sikkim.

I went on the first class Glacier Express from Zermatt to St. Moritz in the month of February and this luxury train ride through the Swiss Alps was one of the most beautiful train journeys I have ever experienced, and not just in Switzerland. If you’re wondering ‘Is the Glacier Express worth it?’, then hopefully this video will answer your question. The Glacier Express is an 8-hour train journey from Zermatt to St. Moritz in Switzerland. It covers some of the most scenic landscapes in Switzerland covering Chur, Andermatt, and the famous bridges around Chur like the Landwasser Viaduct. It’s a beautiful and luxurious experience (the most expensive train ride in Switzerland), but worth every penny! I also talk about how much the Glacier Express costs and a way to do the Glacier Express in a more cost-effective manner. Even though I went on the Glacier Express solo, I actually turned out to be such an amazing experience. I also spent the rest of the evening in snowy St. Moritz. Hope you enjoy this vlog of the Glacier Express! :)

Here's how I spent my first day in Paris, walking around the city and exploring the popular attractions. I had some nice coffee in a Parisian cafe, figured out the metro in Paris, walked down Champs Elysees, saw the Arc de Triomphe, Galeries Lafayette and all the Christmas decoration there plus a stunning view of the Eiffel Tower from the roof, walked by the Seine, The Louvre and of course the Eiffel Tower from up close! This was such a great first day in Paris and I'm already in love with this city! Excited to be traveling solo in Paris and in Europe!

Check out my store: https://www.kritikagoelshop.com
Recently went on a solo trip to Singapore for three days and here’s a vlog about everything I did there!
Booked flights on WEGO: https://wegotravel.onelink.me/cYro/CheapestFlightsxHotels 

This was actually my first proper solo trip abroad (not counting Bali since I spent most days there with a group), and I had such a blast chilling by myself (my second time visiting Singapore though)! I stayed at Boat Quay, which was quite a nice area and was right by the Singapore river. This vlog is from my first two days there where I explore downtown Singapore, see the laser show at Marina Bay Sands, check out the Merlion, Gardens by the Bay, the light and sound show there, and Haji Lane (which is truly a hidden gem) where I tried the famous selfie coffee and also indulged in a bit of shopping!

Check out my store: https://www.kritikagoelshop.com
Hey guys! In this video, I take you through my experience with LASIK Eye surgery before, during, and after the procedure. I share with you everything I know about LASIK and I hope you find this video useful! 😊 Don’t forget to like this video and subscribe to my channel. ❤️

I got LASIK done at Shroff Eye Centre, Kailash Colony, Delhi and my doctor was Dr. Dariel Mathur. If you’re considering getting LASIK done, I would recommend doing your own research and consulting a doctor because everyone’s eyes are different.

A couple of things I forgot to mention in the video: You can’t wear eye make up or get threading done for your eyebrows for an entire month after the surgery.

Hey everyone! I recently went on a trip to Sikkim with my friend Shumnima (who is from Sikkim). In this video, we go on a road trip from Gangtok to Pelling and explore West Sikkim.

This is the second video in my four part series of Sikkim. In this video, we got to Pelling, did a bit of sightseeing there, explored Sky Walk Pelling, Rabdentse Ruins and Pemayengtse Monastery. Also, as usual, tried some delicious local cuisine!

I recently visited Meghalaya with my family and had the most fun time! During our trip to Meghalaya, we visited Shillong, Umiam Lake, places around Shillong, Cherrapunji/Sohra, Double Decker Root Bridge, Dawki, Mawlynnong, tons of waterfalls that Meghalaya is famous for, and Mawphlang Sacred Forest.

This is the second video in the series where we travel from Shillong to Sohra, and on the way visit Dawki - which is famous for it's crystal clear Umngot River, said to be one of the cleanest rivers in Asia and the cleanest river in India, and lies on the Bangladesh border, and Mawlynnong village, which was once awarded the title of the cleanest village in Asia. In Mawlynnong, we visited the Mawlynnong village, and also the single living root bridge, which was so breathtaking!

If you're planning a trip to Dawki, do consider visiting Shnongpdeng nearby which is a little less commercial and offers kayaking and other activities. We missed out on that on our trip, but boating in Dawki was so beautiful and the crystal clear water is such a unique sight to behold. Absolutely loved it!

Also, I've interchangeably used Sohra and Cherrapunji, but the actual name now is Sohra. Cherrapunji seems to be what it's more popularly known as though, so excuse me for saying Cherrapunji.

Check out my store: https://www.kritikagoelshop.com
Went on some crazy rides at the Atlantis Aquaventure Water Park in Dubai! This was our last day in Dubai and we spent it having fun at Aquaventure, which is a water park at Palm Atlantis. We somehow managed to go on every single ride at the park, and ended our day chilling in the lazy river! :D I’m a huge fan of water parks and I absolutely loved the Atlantis waterpark and all the rides it had. What a good way to end our trip. We also went to JBR in the evening and ate some nice food!

I’ve honestly had so much fun editing all these Dubai vlogs and sharing them with you. This trip to Dubai was truly memorable and I’m glad I have these videos up for posterity. Hope you enjoyed these vlogs as much as I did!

In this video, you’ll see what I did on my first day in Prague. We explored the city in a vintage car, visited the Old Town Square, the Prague Castle, had an amazing lunch and tried the famous beer here, went for a beer spa (which was super cool!), a boat ride on the Vltava River from where we saw the Charles Bridge, and finally Manifesto for dinner.

Check out my store: https://www.kritikagoelshop.com
Started 2020 by visiting the charming city of Kolkata. This was my first time visiting Kolkata, and I had such an incredible time exploring the City of Joy solo. I spent three days sightseeing in Kolkata and vlogged the whole experience for you. Since it was my first time here and I came quite unprepared, I wasn’t sure what all to see, but I managed to cover as much as I could in three days. I visited Princep Ghat, Park Street, Victoria Memorial, Kumortuli, took a metro ride, took a ride in the iconic yellow taxi of Kolkata, saw the tram, and went on an incredible walking tour through the culturally diverse neighbourhoods of Kolkata. I also tried some amazing food, the famous Bengali sweets (mishti doi and sandesh), a few cafes and restaurants around Park street and my favourite: puchkas! Also, in case you didn’t know, Kolkata (or Calcutta) was the capital of India during the British rule, and in Kolkata really felt like I had been transported back in time! I loved the vibe of the city.

Check out my store: https://www.kritikagoelshop.com
Recently got the chance to visit the magnificent Sunderbans National Park. In case you didn’t know, it’s the largest deltic region and mangrove forest in the world. I did a one night two day trip. I went solo but since it was with a group, I ended up making some friends. I had such an amazing time on this trip. The Sunderbans are so incredibly beautiful, and so was the village we stayed at. We also got to spot a lot of wildlife like spotted dears, wild boars, crocodiles, monitor lizards and different kinds of birds. All in all, it was quite an adventurous and exciting trip to the Sunderbans.

Hey everyone! I recently went on a trip to Sikkim with my friend Shumnima (who is from Sikkim). This is the third vlog in my four part series of Sikkim. In this video, we explore places around Pelling, visit Khecheopalri Lake, Singshore Bridge (which is the second highest suspension bridge in Asia), go to a village called Uttarey, and witness the magnificent Kanchenjunga ranges from our room! Also, we went on a day trip to Changu / Tsomgo Lake, which was beyond beautiful, and dare I say it, seemed like the ‘Iceland of India’. Hope you enjoy this video :)

I explored the fairy tale town of Freiburg and loved every bit of it! Freiburg I’m Breisgau is a two hour train ride from Zurich and it lies in the Black Forest region of Germany, so there’s lots to see around Freiburg. In this video, I just walked around the old town of Freiburg which was super quaint, checked out the farmer’s market, walked up the bridge on the station, tried some beer, and tried the famous black forest cake :D One of the best things about Freiburg im Breisgau is that it's a green and sustainable city. In the next vlog, you’ll see me learn snow boarding and visiting a thermal bath in Freiburg :) Hope I get to visit Germany and Freiburg again someday!

Check out my store: https://www.kritikagoelshop.com
Hey guys, here’s part 4 of my travel series from Bali, which is the final video in this series, and in this video, I explore the stunning paradise island of Nusa Penida. I did a day trip to Nusa Penida from Seminyak and visited Kelingking Beach, Angel’s Billabong, Broken Beach, and Crystal Bay. I must admit, Nusa Penida is one of the most beautiful and untouched places I’ve ever been to and it’s totally worth visiting!
The best way to get to Nusa Penida is by taking a boat from Sanur in Bali (which is about 45-60 minutes from both Ubud and Seminyak).

Hope you enjoy this video! ❤️

Check out my store: https://www.kritikagoelshop.com
On my first night in Singapore, I decided to stay in a space pod to see what it’s like, and here’s a tour of the space capsule pod. I didn't know what to expect from a capsule hotel but this was quite an experience! The whole place gave me such a futuristic, Star Wars vibe and I couldn’t even imagine such a quirky accommodation to ever exist! Watch all the way till the end to know more about the price, lockers and storage, toilets, and other facilities. The one I stayed at is called MET A Space Pod and is in Boat Quay.

Booked on WEGO: https://wegotravel.onelink.me/cYro/CheapestFlightsxHotels 
→ Airbnb (Rs. 2,200 free travel credit): www.airbnb.co.in/c/kritikag38 

Capsule hotels are basically popular in Japan and other Asian countries and are a type of hotel that features a large number of small bed-sized rooms known as pods. Honestly, the pod turned out to be more spacious and comfortable than expected, and I had a really nice and comfortable stay. I didn’t feel claustrophobic at all (for everyone asking), and it also helped that the hostel was located in a really nice location (Boat Quay).

Highly recommend staying here just for the experience! It’s super cool. :D

It’s part of the three Gili Islands and I spent three nights there during the new years weekend. Had a total blast during my time here in Gili T, went scuba diving and saw 4 turtles, cycled around the island, and swam in the sea to my heart’s content. Also had an epic new years eve party and enjoyed Gili Trawangan's nightlife. Hope you enjoy this video! ❤️

I cover what the Schengen visa is, different types of Schengen visa, how and where to apply, the list of documents you need to submit to get your visa, the visa fee for the Schengen visa, and I’ve also tried to answer some of the questions you guys sent me on Instagram and some general tips for the Schengen visa. This is my fourth time applying for a Schengen visa in four years, so hopefully, this information I’ve shared based on my experience with VFS and the Schengen visa is useful and if you have any more questions, let me know in the comments!

WHO AM I? My Education, Work Experience, Job, YouTube Career and More! Q&A in Hindi

Here’s presenting my first ever video in Hindi and it’s a Hindi Q&A where I answer questions to help you get to know me better. I know a lot of you may already know these things about me but I feel like with all the new subscribers coming in, many people had no idea who I am, what I do for a living and how exactly I make money to travel so I hope this answers all your questions. :) Also, since so many of you keep asking me to try making videos in Hindi, here’s me giving it a shot, just for fun. Hope you like it! :D

Earlier this year, I got to do a trip to New York City and spend a few days there exploring NYC. Just to make things interesting, I thought I’ll take up the challenge of exploring New York on a budget of $25 (which is around 1800 rupees). Considering this small budget, I feel like I managed to cover A LOT of things; I also tried to find free things to do in New York City. I covered Central Park, Times Square, Brooklyn Bridge, The High Line Park and The Vessel at Hudson Yards. I hope you enjoy watching this video. :)

This is the first video in this series, where I fly from Chennai to Guwahati in Assam and spent the day in Guwahati. We basically ended up eating a lot of good food in Guwahati - tried the street food, momos, chaat (special vada pav) in Fancy Bazaar, and an authentic Assamese thali in Guwahati. Although I wasn’t planning on making this video, I’m glad I did. I've also shared the guidelines to travel to Meghalaya right now and information on how I booked this trip! This is not the usual travel vlog, but more of a food vlog, however, so much more to come in my Meghalaya series! Stay tuned :)

I spent four days in Switzerland back in December and here's a vlog of me exploring Switzerland. I originally had plans to spend a longer time in the country and do a lot more things, but due to the restrictions back then, I could only spend four days in Switzerland. Nevertheless, I had such an amazing time exploring Switzerland. Switzerland has always been a dream country for me to visit and it was beyond beautiful! I walked around the beautiful lanes of Zurich, took a train from Zurich to Zermatt where I witnessed some stunning snowy views of the Swiss Alps and the magnificent Matterhorn, took the Gornergrat Bahn to see the Matterhorn up close, went to Lausanne, Montreux, Cailler chocolate factory, and Gruyere to try out some delicious Swiss chocolate and fondue! It was incredible traveling solo in Switzerland and also reuniting with my high school friend after so long traveling with him! Hope you enjoy this vlog as much as I enjoyed my time in Switzerland :) Also, as mentioned in the vlog, I actually had the chance to go back to Switzerland a month and a half later and do everything I missed doing the first time around, so stay tuned for more vlogs from beautiful Switzerland! :)

In this vlog, you can see us exploring Nusa Penida. We visited my most favourite spot in Nusa Penida - Tembeling beach with a natural infinity pool and cave, had lunch at Amok Sunset with a stunning view, and visited Crystal Bay (we visited the more popular spots like Diamond Beach and Kelingking beach in the last vlog). Then took the ferry back to Sanur in Bali the next day where we all tried standup paddle boarding, did some shopping, an amazing Balinese spa, and some partying in Seminyak and La Favela. Can’t believe how quickly this trip to Bali ended but leaving with so many fond memories!

Recently did a weekend trip to Mahabaleshwar to explore and stay at the beautiful and luxurious property of Le Mèridien Mahabaleshwar Resort & Spa. Mahabaleshwar is a popular hill station in Maharashtra (the biggest in the state) and is a 6 hour drive from Mumbai. Spent two nights at the resort and throughly enjoyed my luxury staycation there. We ate some amazing food, did a trek to Helen’s Point and had a breakfast picnic in a tent, tried out a lot of strawberries (even went strawberry picking) and also managed to catch a few touristy spots like Mapro Garden and Parsi Point. So grateful for this incredible experience.

Huge thanks to Le Mèridien Mahabaleshwar Resort & Spa for hosting me and for the amazing hospitality. Had a wonderful stay there! :)

Here’s a travel vlog from Pondicherry, where I brought in this new year 2020! I’ve been to Pondicherry numerous times considering how its only 3 hours away from where I grew up, but each time, it’s such a different and amazing experience. I spent new years eve with my brother in Pondicherry; though I was there for some work, it was such a fun trip! We ate some amazing food, tried out some cute cafes Pondicherry is famous for and walked around the beautiful lanes of White Town, the French part of the city. Hope you enjoy this Pondicherry travel vlog of mine! :)

Had an impromptu Holi at home and spoke about it on my Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/kritika_goel​), sharing my thoughts below :)

Growing up, Holi was my favorite festival but my version of Holi was very different from what you’ve probably grown up with. Here in South India, Holi isn’t really celebrated, in fact we didn’t even get a day off from school on Holi. I don’t think Holi colors were even sold here, and for context, I didn’t even know what a pichkari was until I got a little older. 😅
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
So what we’d do instead was that on the Holi weekend, my family and a few close friends would get together, have buckets of colored water (thanks to my mom getting creative with food color 😃) and have the most fun time splashing water on each other. That’s Holi for me, just goofing around and having fun with family (and of course, taking photos haha). 🤗
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
So much has changed since then but Holi has still remained this low key yet fun time with family. Hope you’re all celebrating at home with the people you love (please don’t head out given the times we’re in 🙈). Happy Holi to you and your family! 💛🌈

I went on a week long trip to Czech Republic in the month of August and here’s the third and final vlog from my trip! ❤️ I did this trip with the tourism board of Czech Republic and it was such a memorable one! In this video, you’ll see we exploring cities in South Moravia - basically Brno and Mikulov. Brno is the second largest city in Czech, and was without a doubt my most favourite city in Czech Republic, and if you watched this video, you’ll know why - it literally looks like a fairytale land!
😍

In Brno, we explored Špilberk Castle, the Cathedral, the main square and a ton of cute spots. We also got a chance to check out a few concerts because we visited during the time of Brno Music Marathon. We ended out trip in the cute town of Mikulov, and explored some vineyards along the way! Also got to see glimpses of Vienna in Austria because our flight back from was from there.

A huge thanks to Czech Tourism for taking me on this trip! ❤️

A DAY AT UNIVERSAL STUDIOS SINGAPORE | Went to an amusement park ALONE!

In today’s vlog, I spend a day exploring and chilling at Universal Studios Singapore all by myself. I’ve never been to an amusement park alone before but this was quite an experience! Literally went on every ride and made a friend as well! :D
Also took full advantage of being solo by using the single rider line and not having to wait in long queues so that was awesome! I think my favorite rides were the Mummy ride and the Transformers one.
I also ended up exploring Sentosa Island a bit, watched the  laser show, the light and sound show called Crane Dhow, and the Merlion. Super fun day overall!

In this video, I go from Zurich to Interlaken by train, explore the town of Interlaken which lies between two lakes, and the highlight of my trip - skydiving in Interlaken! I never imagined I’d go skydiving twice, that too in Switzerland on a solo trip, and in the winter, but it was one of the most beautiful experiences of my life! If you’re planning a trip to Switzerland and specifically to Interlaken, definitely experience skydiving in Interlaken!

The top of Rigi was the most wind I’ve ever experienced in life 😅 but overall, it turned out to be such a spectacular day with some stunning views. I did a day trip to Mount Rigi from Zurich (in February 2022) where I went on top of Rigi Kulm, hiked a bit in the snow, took a beautiful train down to Vitznau by Lake Lucerne from where I took a boat to Lucerne and explored the city by night! Also, I was actually with a friend of mine who was too shy to be on camera but in case you were wondering who took some of my shots, it was him! We had some delicious raclette at night, and let’s just say it’s become one of my favourite dishes! :D Hope you enjoy this vlog from Switzerland’s most beautiful city - Lucerne :)

We ate A LOT of different types of food, some of which was very new and unique to me, and I have to say, if you’re planning a trip to Mumbai and love food, you have to try out these places for sure. The street food in Mumbai is amazing and I can’t believe it took me so long to try some of these restaurants/food items.

1. Aaswad, Dadar
2. Ashok Vada Pav, Dadar
3. Anand Food Stall, Vile Parle
4. Elco, Bandra

Finally, I’m sharing with you: how I take Instagram pictures BY MYSELF while traveling solo. I recently visited Mahabaleshwar and thought I’ll take you behind the scenes of what my Instagram photoshoots typically look like while traveling. It involves a lot of early mornings, setting up my camera, awkward eye contact with strangers, and of course, I share my tips on how to take your photos yourself, the equipment I use, tips on how to pose, what clothes to wear, and general composition and photography tips. A lot of people seem to assume I travel with a team who helps me create content but now you know all my filming secrets! :D

I spent a month traveling solo across Europe, and the first place I visited on my solo trip was Paris in France! This is day 3 in Paris, and I spent the day exploring the Louvre, finally trying out croissants, walking by the Seine, checking out the Eiffel Tower, eating crepes and macarons from Laduree, doing some shopping in Champs Elysees, and eating amazing food! Really enjoyed being solo in Paris and exploring the city on foot.

Check out my store: https://www.kritikagoelshop.com
Hey guys! Here’s the second vlog from my recent trip to Dubai with my family! I’m so excited to be sharing these Dubai vlogs with you. They’re more raw, personal and fun (if I may say so myself hehe). In this vlog, we spent the day at Dubai Mall, went on top of the magnificent Burj Khalifa, ate some middle easter food, did some shopping, visited the aquarium and the underwater zoo, and basically just had a chill day at the mall. The highlight was being on top of the world at the Burj. Hope you enjoy this vlog!

Here’s how I usually book hotels for cheap! I visited Mumbai recently for a couple of days and here’s a staycation vlog of me staying at Trident Hotel BKC.

This was my first trip in 9 months so I was a bit skeptical to go out, so it’s unlike my usual staycation vlogs, but I hope you enjoy it nonetheless. I booked two nights’ stay for Rs. 3,000 which is so crazy! Watch the video to see how I did that. This is how I usually book flights and hotels, and I feel like they’re the most expensive part of a trip so this travel hack always helps me out! In this vlog, I explain how to use credit cards to travel for cheap. Also, in this video, I did a fun staycation by myself so I give you a room tour, ate some delicious food and overall, it was a great first trip after 9 months hehe.

I recently visited Meghalaya with my family and had the most fun time! During our trip to Meghalaya, we visited Shillong, Umiam Lake, places around Shillong, Cherrapunji/Sohra, Double Decker Root Bridge, Dawki, Mawlynnong, tons of waterfalls, and Mawphlong Sacred Forest.

This is the third vlog from my Meghalaya series and in this video, we trekked to the Double Decker Living Root bridge in Sohra / Cherrapunjee. This trek involves going down 3500 steps and coming back up 3500 steps so it was quite intense and I wouldn’t recommend it for elderly people or for someone who has knee issues. But having said that, this was such a FUN day and seeing the double decker root bridge was totally worth the hike!

Sohra is one of the wettest places on the planet, and home to a lot of living root bridges. The one we visited in this video  is The Double Decker Living Root Bridge in Nongriat Village, and as you can see, it has two levels to it.

While it's possible to trek to the Double Decker Root Bridge in one day, if you have the time, I recommend spending a night here in Nongriat Village (there are a few homestays there), and also visit Rainbow Falls (which are an hour or so away from here by walk). There’s also a Blue Lagoon which we missed seeing so you could try covering that too. But overall, this trek was a great experience, and the highlight for me was swimming in the water near the Double Decker Living Root Bridge. Totally worth visiting this place if you’re planning a trip to Meghalaya and Sohra/Cherrapunjee.

I hosted a group trip to the Maldives where some of my subscribers joined me. We had the most amazing few days there snorkeling, scuba diving, seeing sharks and sting rays swim at the beach, visiting a beautiful sandbank, swimming with turtles, seeing the most beautiful sunsets, and even some bioluminescence. This was my first time exploring a local island in the Maldives and it was quite a contrasting yet amazing experience compared to staying on a resort island.

In case you’re wondering, the cost of this trip was Rs. 69,000 (including domestic flights but excluding intentional flights), so visiting a local island in the Maldives is way more budget-friendly and affordable compared to resort islands.

We made vegetarian (eggless) steamed baos which turned out super soft and fluffy, a chilli paneer stuffing, and a peanut sauce to go with it, and these veg baos turned out soooo delicious! If you try making these baos at home, the recipe is down below :)

————————————

🍴RECIPE🍴

BAOS:
1. Mix 3/4th tablespoon active dry yeast, 1 tablespoon sugar, and 3/4th cup lukewarm water and leave it aside for approx 10 mins till the yeast activates.
2. In a large bowl, mix 3.5 cups maida, 1.5 teaspoon baking powder, 1.5 tbs sugar and 1/4th teaspoon salt. Mix well.
3. Add to this, the yeast water, 3/4th cup warm milk, and 3 tbs oil (any edible oil works).
4. Combine everything and knead the dough on a flat surface for 6-7 minutes till it becomes smooth. Add more flour if it is very sticky, or a little bit of water if it is very dry.
5. Keep this aside for one and a half hour covered with a wet cloth, till your dough doubles in size. (You can keep it in a warm place for faster proofing)
6. When it’s done, punch the dough down again and knead for 5 mins to remove air bubbles.
7. Roll out the dough into 1 cm thick circle and approx 3 inch diameter and apply some oil, fold it, press slightly in the middle, place it on a banana leaf/parchment paper, cover them with a damp cloth, and keep aside for 30 minutes for second proofing.
8. Once they have risen, you can steam them in an idli steamer for 12-13 minutes, and your baos will be ready.

CHILLI PANEER STUFFING:
1. Deseed 15 Kashmiri chilis and soak them in hot water for half an hour. Discard the water and blend the chilis smooth.
2. Heat 3 tbs oil in a pan, add 10 tbs finely chopped garlic, 2 teaspoons grated ginger, and sauté for 2 minutes to allow the raw smell to go (don’t brown it).
3. Add the chilli paste and cook till the oil separates for about 5 minutes. Remove this paste into a container and keep it aside.
4. In the same pan, add 2 tablespoon oil, 1.5 cups chopped onion and sauté till translucent.
5. Add 1 cup chopped green capsicum, and sauté for another 2 minutes on medium flame.
6. Add the pre-cooked paste that we made to this and mix well for another 2 minutes.
7. Add 5 tablespoon light soy sauce (or 2.5 tbs regular soy sauce), 3 tbs tomato ketchup, and 2 teaspoons chilli sauce, 1 teaspoon brown sugar (regular sugar is fine too), some salt and pepper to taste. Stir this well.
8. Mix 4 teaspoons of cornflour in a separate bowl with a cup of water to make a thin slurry, add this slurry to the pan with everything we made so far, and allow it to simmer till we get a thick sauce (for about 5 minutes).
9. Add cubed paneer (1/2 kg paneer), and gently toss till the pieces are coated completely.
10. Remove from the flame and add chopped spring onions for garnishing.

Place this paneer filling in the opening of the bao and garnish with carrot, cucumbers, spring onions and roasted sesame seeds, and serve with peanut sauce.

PEANUT SAUCE:
Blend the following ingredients in a mixer to a smooth sauce:
1. Roasted peanuts - 1/2 cup
2. 2 flakes of garlic
3. Roasted sesame - 2 tablespoon
4. Tamarind paste - 1 tablespoon
5. Jaggery - 1 tablespoon
6. Salt to taste
7. Kashmiri red chilli powder - 1 teaspoon
8. Soy sauce - 1.5 tablespoon
9. Water - 1/2 cup or as required

Hey everyone, sharing a day in my life during quarantine vlog today. This was super raw and casual, and now that we’re all at home due to the lockdown, I’m taking things slow, learning to cook, spending time with family, watching Netflix, learning new things and taking online courses, and of course, working. :P I hope you enjoy watching this video of what my day is like at home. :) Also, this is kind of like a house tour as well since you can pretty much see most of my house (I’m sorry I’m not really going to do a house tour video because this is my parents’ house but I hope this works :D)

Day 5 of my family vacation to Dubai was spent doing a day trip to Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi is the capital of UAE, and is about two hours away from Dubai. We spent the day exploring the stunning Grand Mosque, which is one of the major highlights of Abu Dhabi, and the other half of the day at Ferrari World. We went on the world’s fastest roller coaster, which was EPIC, the world’s tallest loop rollercoaster and a few other awesome rides. Overall it was a fun day trip to Abu Dhabi.

Hey guys! Here’s the third vlog from my recent trip to Dubai with my family! I’m so excited to be sharing these Dubai vlogs with you because they’re more raw, personal and fun! In this vlog, we explore Old Dubai, the spice souk (where we ended up doing a lot of shopping), took an abra ride, visited the Old Dubai Souq, and then went on an exciting desert safari with dune bashing, quad biking, belly dancing and a cool fire show! Also, we're staying in the world's tallest hotel (Hotel Gevora) with the most epic pool, so ended our day by unwinding there. All-in-all a very fun day! Super excited about tomorrow’s vlog though! Stay tuned. :)

I recently had the chance to explore Hong Kong with Hong Kong Tourism Board and Tripoto, and I vlogged the whole experience! This is my second vlog from the trip and in this video, I take the super cool cable car (with a glass bottom) to visit the Big Buddha in Lantau Island, go to the second highest bar in the world, go shopping at the Ladies Market, learn stand up paddle boarding in Sai Kung, eat food at Michelin star restaurants, learn to make dim sums, and visit the Victoria Peak for some stunning views of the city. All this and more! :)

In this vlog, we also see how the airport is doing its bit to be more sustainable, how they manage their waste and treat their own water, and also see sustainable aviation fuel live in action.

I recently visited Meghalaya with my family and had the most fun time! During our trip to Meghalaya, we visited Shillong, Umiam Lake, places around Shillong, Cherrapunji/Sohra, tons of waterfalls and even a cave, Double Decker Root Bridge, Dawki, Mawlynnong, tons of waterfalls, and Mawphlang Sacred Forest.

This is the fourth vlog from my Meghalaya series and in this video, we explored the famous caves and waterfalls around Sohra Cherrapunji. Unfortunately, since we visited in March, Dainthlen Falls, Seven Sister falls and Nohkhalikai falls were mostly dried up but I absolutely loved Wei Sawdong Waterfalls and Elephant Falls. Also, Mawsmai cave was one of the highlights of the day for sure, such a mysterious cave with limestones. We also, drove down from Sohra to Shillong in Meghalaya and spent the evening exploring the famous Police Bazaar in Shillong and the food culture of Shillong. Hope you enjoy this vlog of me exploring waterfalls & caves in Sohra, Meghalaya!

You get panoramic views of the Swiss Alps! 🏔❤️

Watch the full vlog here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-NjAVmaVVo

It has three different classes: Excellence class, first class, and second class and the prices vary depending on which class you’re in, the season and whether you’re doing the whole journey or only a part of it.

Here are the prices (approx since currency exchange keeps changing):
Second class: Rs. 15,000
First class: Rs. 25,000
Excellence class: Rs. 52,000
Yup, it’s quite expensive! 😅🤑

However, the cool part is the first and second classes are included in the Eurail pass (you just need to pay 40 franks extra to reserve your seat) so that’s what I did since I had a @eurail pass anyway for all my train rides! So this works out to be more cost effective if you’re planning a lot of train rides on your trip to Europe.

They also serve food (at an extra cost for first and second class), but you can also carry your own (which is what I did 😋).

Would you add this to your bucket list? Full vlog from here on my YouTube channel! 🤗

I recently visited Meghalaya with my family and had the most fun time! During our trip to Meghalaya, we visited Shillong, Umiam Lake, places around Shillong, Cherrapunji/Sohra, tons of waterfalls and even a cave, Double Decker Root Bridge, Dawki, Mawlynnong, tons of waterfalls, and Mawphlang Sacred Forest.

This is the fifth vlog from my Meghalaya series and in this video, we explored Shillong and Meghalaya's enchanting sacred forest - Mawphlang Sacred Forest. We visited the famous Cathedral in Shillong, Shillong's Golf Course, Cafe ML 05 which is on the outskirts of Shillong. Police Bazaar for some shopping and dinner at Shillong's City Hut Dhaba. Meghalaya is famous for its sacred forest and the one we visited is one of the most popular sacred forests in Meghalaya. 
All in all this was such a fun day in Meghalaya, and the Mawphlang Sacred Forest was definitely the highlight of our day in Shillong!

I got my hands on the latest Sony ZV1; this almost feels like the end of an era because I’ve made most of my videos using the Canon G7X ii but super excited to be switching up my gear and using the Sony ZV1. It has some amazing features and in this video, I do an unboxing of the ZV1, do a bit of vlogging with it to try out its different features and see how the quality is compared to my Sony A6500 (and also I drove for the first time ever on my channel haha). I wish this was sponsored by Sony but it’s not :P Hope you enjoy this video. :)

I recently visited Meghalaya with my family and had the most fun time! During our trip to Meghalaya, we visited Shillong, Umiam Lake, places around Shillong, Cherrapunji/Sohra, tons of waterfalls and even a cave, Double Decker Root Bridge, Dawki, Mawlynnong, tons of waterfalls, Laitlum Grand Canyon and Mawphlang Sacred Forest.

This is the sixth and last vlog from my Meghalaya series and in this video, we explored the majestic Laitlum Grand Canyon, which is an hour and a half away from Shillong. The term Laitlum translates to 'end of hills' and the place totally does justice to its name! The views from Laitlum Canyon were spectacular and Laitlum should totally be on your list of places to visit in Meghalaya! We also explored a bit of Shillong - Don Bosco Museum to be specific. And finally ended the day in our hotel at Laitumkhrah, Shillong. We also visited the magnificent Umiam Lake the next morning on our way back to Guwahati. This was such an amazing trip and I'm so glad I got to visit Meghalaya with my family :)

Check out my store: https://www.kritikagoelshop.com
Food tours and walking tours are my favorite way to explore a new place and although Delhi isn’t a new place by any means and I’ve lived there for a few years as well, I’d never actually explored Old Delhi. So this time while I was in Delhi, I decided to do a food and walking tour of Old Delhi and tried out some of the BEST Indian street food spots in Delhi! I also visited Jama Masjid, Dariba Kalan, Paranthewali Gali, Naughara, Sisganj gurdwara, Lal Mandir and a bunch of other places!

We did a combo tour of the food and sightseeing tours conducted by Delhi Magic. Here are the links:

On my first trip to Germany back in February, I decided to explore the Black Forest region and take a snowboarding lesson. This was my first ever time snowboarding, and what better place to do it than in the beautiful Black Forest region? In this video, I visited my friend in Freiburg in Germany, and you'll see me snowboarding in Feldberg Black Forest, walking around the beautiful town of Titisee, and checking out the Keidel thermal bath in Freiburg im Breisgau. I had such a great time visiting Germany, and even though this was a short trip, I hope to be back in Germany again someday!

Check out my store: https://www.kritikagoelshop.com
While in Hong Kong, I decided to do a day trip to Macau to explore the Vegas of the East. There are a ton of things to do in Macau like checking out the casinos and hotels (I went to the Venetian), visiting the old part of Macau where the Senado Square is, eating egg tarts and other Portuguese dishes, and the Ruins of St. Paul’s. You can also go bungee jumping there from the Macau Tower, but we didn’t really feel like doing it.

This video is a one-day itinerary of Macau including how to get there, the visa, and things you can do there. Hope you enjoy watching!

A lot of credit cards offer something called the Priority Pass complimentary along with your card (some have limited visits and the more premium cards offer unlimited lounge access). You can pay and buy the Priority Pass too (last time I checked, the unlimited one was for around $350-$400 per year), but you can get it complimentary along with some credit cards.

A few of that I know offer the Priority Pass are:
1. HDFC Infinia
2. Citi Prestige
3. HDFC Regalia (limited)
4. HDFC Regalia First (limited)
5. Axis Privilege
6. Yes First Exclusive
7. ICICI Sapphiro
8. HDFC Diners Black (no Priority Pass but offers lounge access around the world)
and many more! So do some research to figure out what card you’re eligible for and get that free lounge access! 😃

Apart from this, a lot of debit and credit cards also let you access domestic lounges in India. I didn’t know my debit card gave me lounge access for a good 4-5 years of having it so check online/with your bank to see if they offer lounge access.

Access to airport lounges is great to have, especially if you travel frequently. They usually have free food and drinks, good WiFi, comfortable seating with charging ports, newspapers/magazines, and usually a great view! 😍

I get asked this SOOO often, so hope this helps! Share if you found this useful 😊",71388,1995,21

I spent an entire day exploring different parts of Ostrava like the City Hall, Landek Park and the Iron Factory. We then drove to Brno, which is the second largest city in Czech Republic (you’ll see more from Brno in myy next vlog). Huge thanks to Czech Tourism for taking me on this trip! ❤️

Hey guys, sharing a huge life update with you all today. Can’t believe I’m having to move out of my apartment in Mumbai, that too without seeing it one last time :( but the times are such that this seemed like the best decision at the moment. I’m excited to finally be reunited with all my stuff hehe and all the rent money I’m going to be saving! I’ve explained the details of why I moved, how I made the move happen, and also unpack all my boxes along with you guys. :) Hope you enjoy watching!
