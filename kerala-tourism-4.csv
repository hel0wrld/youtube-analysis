In some places, it is also known as Kaduvakali. The rhythmic dance is enacted by artistes who are dressed as a puli (cheetah) or a kaduva (tiger). While Pulikali is an art form performed on the outskirts of Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam, the dance in Thrissur, which has an ancestry of about 200 years, is considered the oldest. It is also the most popular and classical of all types of Pulikali. Special training is mandatory to perform this art form.
