ABOUT ME
I'm Varun.
I am a full-time traveller now (yes, I quit my job to follow my dreams). I love solo travelling & meeting people. After travelling extensively in Incredible India for years, I stepped out of my country and realised, how beautiful the world is! I started making travel web series in Hindi full of travel tips and tricks, especially for budget travel and sustainable tourism. My dream is to inspire people to explore this beautiful world and learn the best things to make our world a better place to live in. I was awarded the prestigious 'National Tourism Award' by the Government of India for my contributions in the field of promotion of Tourism. Thanks to my viewers, I now get invitations from across the globe to visit their places and show them to the world.

After a short visit to Alex and Marina’s apartment in Byisk, I started to hitchhike for Gorno-Altaysk, the capital town of Altai Republic. The total distance between Gorno Altaysk and Byisk is 108 kilometres. Thanks to Alex and Marina who dropped me on the outskirts of the Byisk town. I always choose to start hitchhiking from a point outside of the city. There are more chances of getting a lift for a long distance if you stand outside of a city or town.

ABOUT ME
I'm Varun.
I am a full-time traveller now (yes, I quit my job to follow my dreams). I love solo travelling & meeting people. After travelling extensively in Incredible India for years, I stepped out of my country and realised, how beautiful the world is! I started making travel web series in Hindi full of travel tips and tricks, especially for budget travel and sustainable tourism. My dream is to inspire people to explore this beautiful world and learn the best things to make our world a better place to live in. I was awarded the prestigious 'National Tourism Award' by the Government of India for my contributions to the field of promotion of Tourism. Thanks to my viewers, I now get invitations from across the globe to visit their places and show them to the world.

I travelled from Delhi to Bali with Malaysia Airlines. I enjoyed the in-flight entertainment, and comfortable reclining seats and relished the vegetarian food. Although it would be better if the flagship carrier of Malaysia can offer more variety of food for vegetarians. After reaching Bali, the first target was to get a Visa on arrival. Bali offers free Visa-on-Arrival for Indian citizens.

YOU CAN'T LEAVE THIS COUNTRY' - Worst Immigration experience (ENG SUB) | EP #40,"This was my worst ever immigration experience. Despite having all the valid documents and permissions, this Serbian immigration officer said, ""You can't board the flight. You can't leave the country as you have overstayed your visa in Serbia"". Watch this video to know the proper Serbian immigration rules for Indians. However, this situation can happen to anyone, anywhere in the world, so watch it and get prepared. This video was shot on 21st November 2020. 

Indians get visa-free entry to Serbia for up to 30 days. 
Foreign nationals (including Indians) having a valid visa or resident permit issued by Schengen, UK or US may, without prior visa application, enter, transit or stay in the Republic of Serbia for up to 90 days during a six-month period, but not exceeding the expiring date of the said visas or residence permits.

This video is about my visit to the Crocodile Park in Mauritius, also called La Vanille Crocodile Park. The experience at the park was not very positive. Though I have shared important information like the entrance fee for Vanille Crocodile Park, etc. You will also see a glimpse of my hotel Sofitel and Hotel Telfair. These are some of the luxury hotels in Mauritius and usually preferred for Honeymoon and destination weddings. Yes, Mauritius is one of the ideal places for destination weddings for Indians. Thereafter I visited Frederica Nature Reserve (Mauritius), also called Heritage Nature Reserve. Check to know about the prices of different activities like trekking or a trip to the Frederica Nature Reserve in modified 4-wheeled Land Cruiser. Also, watch me doing Canoeing and playing Golf at Heritage Golf club. Though something bad happened there. Watch this video to see what was that!

In this video, you will see me 'hunting' for the best mobile network in Egypt. Based on the feedback from many people I chose to buy Vodafone. The sim cost me 150 LE. There are other mobile networks like Etisalat, Orange (formerly Mobinil) and We (Government owned). Talking about the availability of vegetarian food in Egypt, it is not that difficult as it was for me in most of the South-East Asian countries. I have shared my food expenses in this video. Also, you will see some incidents of tourist hassles. The beginning of the video is about a corrupt practice which I found the hotels do in Egypt.

My dream is to inspire people to explore this beautiful world and learn the best things to make our world a better place to live in. I was awarded the prestigious 'National Tourism Award' by the Government of India for my contributions in the field of promotion of Tourism.

This video is based on the initial days of my trip to Turkey. I stayed in Dongyang Hotel near Sultan Ahmet area in Istanbul for a few days. You will get an idea about the cost of a hotel or hostel in Istanbul in this video. I visited a supermarket called Sok in the Sirkeci area of Istanbul. I have shared the cost of things I bought from there. If you are also a vegetarian budget traveller like me, this part of the video would be helpful for you.  I visited a souvenir shop near Sultan Ahmet called Ottoman Art in Sirkeci, bought some souvenirs from there. Thereafter I met some volunteers who help tourist visiting Istanbul. Watch the interesting conversation with the school girls about India, Bollywood, Amir Khan, Shahrukh Khan, Indian soap operas like Utaran. They revealed some interesting things about their mother and grandmothers in this context ;) I also visited a local mobile sim shop near Sultan Ahmet to find the cheapest mobile networks available in Turkey. Then you'll watch interesting sessions with Turkish & Afghan fruit sellers and at the end, you will see me travelling in Istanbul tram to Kabatas for visiting Taksim Square. There also I met an interesting tour guide who helped me reach Taksim Square and understand a few basics about Turkey.

Is Couchsurfing safe for a solo traveller? I have been asked this question a number of times, especially when it comes to Couchsurfing for female travel. This video is based on my experience with a Female Couchsurfer in Turkey. I visited her place in Tekirdag, Thrace region in September 2018. 

My Couchsurfing host took me to Uçmakdere, a small village in the hills near Tekirdag. Distance from Tekirdag to Ucmakdere is around 35 kilometres and become quite scenic after the hills start. We relished delicious Gozleme and the Turkish Ayran. Watch this video to know about these local Turkish delicacies.

Watch this video to know why almost every Russian loved this Indian tourist! An Indian backpacker took this video during hitchhiking in Russia in 2017. The location in the video is Chusky Tract in the beautiful Altai Mountains. To be specific about the location the video was shot between Barangol & Onguday in the Altay region of Russia. This area is in the Siberia, which is one of the coldest parts on earth. So you will see a lot of snow in a particular stretch (Seminsky Pass) in this video.

In this video, you will see a tourist scam in Istanbul. It is based on my visit to famous tourist places in Istanbul like Taksim Square, Istiklal street and Sultan Ahmet. I visited there in September 2018. During my visit to the Istiklal street, I was approached by two people who pretended to be a tourist. Watch this video to know how did they approached me and tried to get friendly. They asked me to join for bear, which I refused. I was already warned about this by the staff at the hostel where I stayed. The same thing happened with me on the next day in Sultan Ahmet, another popular tourist place in Istanbul. Usually, these people target Solo tourists. After watching this video, I am sure you will come to know about Dos and Donts while travelling in Istanbul and how to handle such situations.

I started making travel web-series in Hindi with full of travel tips and tricks, especially for budget travel and sustainable tourism. My dream is to inspire people to explore this beautiful world and learn the best things to make our world a better place to live in.

This video is about one of the best bus journeys I have ever had! Thanks to this little friend...  I travelled on a bus from Istanbul to Tekirdag. Took Istanbul Seyahat bus to Tekirdag from the main bus terminal called Esenler Otogar or Büyük Otogar. It is located in Bayrampasa district so people also call it Bayrampaşa Bus Terminal. A bus terminal is called Otogar in Turkish. If I am not wrong Esenler Otogar is the bus terminal for many international buses for Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, Balkan countries and other Middle-East countries. Watch this video to know how was my experience of buying a ticket at Esenler Bus Terminal. 

The bus journey from Istanbul to Tekirgag was a bliss. We took state road D100 which connects Bulgaria to Iran. The road was good. Landscapes were great. But the best part of this journey was my travel companion. A little boy who was accompanying his father, also the bus pilot. You'll see him as well in the video. Bus fare from Istanbul to Tekirdag is 32 Lira in Istanbul Seyahat bus.

ABOUT ME
I'm Varun.
I am a full-time traveller now (yes, I quit my job to follow my dreams). I love solo travelling & meeting people. After travelling extensively in Incredible India for years, I stepped out of my country and realised, how beautiful the world is! I started making travel web-series in Hindi with full of travel tips and tricks, especially for budget travel and sustainable tourism. My dream is to inspire people to explore this beautiful world and learn the best things to make our world a better place to live in. I was awarded the prestigious 'National Tourism Award' by the Government of India for my contributions in the field of promotion of Tourism. Thanks to my viewers, because of whom now I get invitations from across the globe to visit their places and show them to the world.

# Cheap hotels in Europe - https://goo.gl/rNBD2r
# 15 days in Europe in just 10,000 Rupees - https://goo.gl/M2Ux1k
# Blog - http://www.touristhelpline.com/planning-europe-trip-from-india/

I did my first ever trip to Europe in late 2016. I learnt a lot of things during this trip which eventually helped me to shape my budget travelling in more organised way. Interestingly, I managed all the expenditures during my 15 days long trip in just Rs. 10,000 (INR). You must read my blog to know how I made this possible. Here is the link http://www.touristhelpline.com/i-travelled-europe-in-10000/

Based on the experience of that trip, I am going to share some information which may be very helpful for everyone who is planning to do a Europe trip, especially for the first timers. 

The inputs are broadly based on these topics - 
 
1. Which are the best countries in Europe for a budget traveller? (After watching this video and other ones coming up in this series, I am sure you will know that travelling in Europe is no more a costly affair)

2. Which are the cheapest flights from India to Europe? (I have shared some tricks which will help you to get cheap flight tickets to Europe)

3. What are the visa formalities to visit European countries? (Though you are required to do a bit of paperwork to get the visa but all the hard work pay at the end. After getting THIS visa you can visit almost 26 countries)

ABOUT ME
I'm Varun.
I am a full-time traveller now (yes, I quit my job to follow my dreams). I love solo travelling & meeting people. After travelling extensively in Incredible India for years, I stepped out of my country and realised, how beautiful the world is! I started making travel web-series in Hindi with full of travel tips and tricks, especially for budget travel and sustainable tourism. My dream is to inspire people to explore this beautiful world and learn the best things to make our world a better place to live in. I was awarded the prestigious 'National Tourism Award' by the Government of India for my contributions in the field of promotion of Tourism. Thanks to my viewers, because of whom now I get invitations from across the globe to visit their places and show them to the world.

ABOUT ME
I'm Varun.
I am a full-time traveller now (yes, I quit my job to follow my dreams). I love solo travelling & meeting people. After travelling extensively in Incredible India for years, I stepped out of my country and realised, how beautiful the world is! I started making travel web series in Hindi full of travel tips and tricks, especially for budget travel and sustainable tourism. My dream is to inspire people to explore this beautiful world and learn the best things to make our world a better place to live in. I was awarded the prestigious 'National Tourism Award' by the Government of India for my contributions in the field of promotion of Tourism. Thanks to my viewers, I now get invitations from across the globe to visit their places and show them to the world.

playlist - https://goo.gl/dOUJck (Hitchhiking in Thailand)


This was my first flight with Air Asia. 
Air Asia is one of the major low budget airlines in Asia. Sometimes they offer dirt cheap fares, but I had few apprehensions before flying with them for the first time. I heard that they are very strict at charging for every kilo over the stipulated weight limit. I also came to know that the seats are not comfortable and offer very less leg space. 

Watch this video to know how was my first experience with Air Asia. I took their flight from Kolkata to Bangkok (CCU to DMK)

This is the first day of my Russian trip. I am in Omsk. In this video, you can see how to get a tourist sim in Russia. Also, you will come to know how to get Russian Ruble. Instead of using a money exchanger I used an ATM which had its services available in English. Surprisingly, I got an excellent exchange rate by using the ATM. I have shared the ATM's receipt and the SMS I got from my Indian bank in the video. I don't know this happened because of the Indian bank or it was a special feature of the Russian bank which owns the ATM. I can recommend this bank's ATM to every traveller as it gives a better exchange rate.  

In this video, there is a query about a free offer provided by the mobile operator. Watch it and reply in the comments section.

This video is based on my quest for the graves of Indian Soldiers in Gallipoli, Turkey. I started my day from the Gelibolu (Gallipoli) town. Took a local bus from Gelibolu to Kilitbahir. Visited war cemeteries, monuments and a War Museum (Çanakkale Destanı Tanıtım Merkezi) also called Epic Promotion Centre, Kabatepe Tanıtma Merkezi Ve Müzesi. I have shared the museum and 3D show fees in the video. Afterwards, I visited Directorate of Gallipoli Historical Site (Çanakkale Savaşları Gelibolu) to collect more information about Indian soldiers who fought for the British during the World War 1 against the Ottoman empire in Gallipoli. In the end, I visited the Beach Cemetery, Gallipoli.

I am a full-time traveller now (yes, I quit my job to follow my dreams). I love solo travelling & meeting people. After travelling extensively in Incredible India for years, I stepped out of my country and realised, how beautiful the world is! I started making travel web-series in Hindi with full of travel tips and tricks, especially for budget travel and sustainable tourism. My dream is to inspire people to explore this beautiful world and learn the best things to make our world a better place to live in. I was awarded the prestigious 'National Tourism Award' by the Government of India for my contributions in the field of promotion of Tourism. Thanks to my viewers, because of whom now I get invitations from across the globe to visit their places and show them to the world.

I started with hitchhiking in Langkawi. Met a few wonderful people of Langkawi. They dropped me at a hostel which I initially booked, but probably due to overbooking the hostel arranged a better stay in a nearby hostel. So I finally got to stay in 'Villa Thai' which is a hostel/hotel near Cenang beach. They have rooms as well as a dormitory for tourists. After that, I visited Cenang beach. In the video, you can see many hotels, guesthouses, hostel near Cenang beach. I Spent a good time walking on the beach and Cenang street.

This video is based on my experience at the Istanbul Ataturk Airport. Information shared in this video is based on - the best and cheapest way to go from Istanbul airport to city centre. I travelled via Istanbul Metro from Istanbul airport to Sultan Ahmet, a tourist hub in Istanbul. I have also shared inputs on sim card in Turkey. For eg, I have mentioned the cost of Turkcell and Vodafone sim available at the airport. Although there are many other sim card companies in Turkey which you will come to know in upcoming videos. What is the best way to get Turkish Lira at the airport! I used the HSBC atm at Istanbul airport to withdraw money. Though I got a poor exchange rate. After withdrawing the money I purchased a smartcard which is valid in all trams, metro, buses and even toilets in Istanbul, the name of this smartcard is IstanbulKart. Watch this video to know IstanbulKart fares and how to get IstanbulKart at the airport?

ABOUT ME
I'm Varun.
I am a full-time traveller now (yes, I quit my job to follow my dreams). I love solo travelling & meeting people. After travelling extensively in Incredible India for years, I stepped out of my country and realised, how beautiful the world is! I started making travel web series in Hindi full of travel tips and tricks, especially for budget travel and sustainable tourism. My dream is to inspire people to explore this beautiful world and learn the best things to make our world a better place to live in. I was awarded the prestigious 'National Tourism Award' by the Government of India for my contributions in the field of promotion of Tourism. Thanks to my viewers, because of whom now I get invitations from across the globe to visit their places and show them to the world.

On the second day of my Canada trip, I took a boat trip to Niagara Falls on Hornblower cruise. I have shared the ticket price & timings of the Hornblower cruise. If you are looking for a hotel near Niagara falls offering the best views of the falls! Let me tell you that I stayed in the Sheraton on the Falls hotel and my room, as well as the restaurant, offered a great view of all the 3 falls of Niagara Falls. There are many other places to visit near Niagara Falls like Skylon Tower which has an observatory deck to have a panoramic view of Niagara Falls & the areas in USA & Canada around it. This video also includes a few glimpses of QEW expressway which is the road from Toronto to Niagara Falls or US border.

In this video, you will watch me crossing the Nile river in the cheapest possible way. I just paid 1 L.E (3.5 Indian Rupees) to cross the Nile river in a public boat. Again I was hassled by the touts, taxi drivers, travel agents, etc. at the West Bank. I have also shared my experience of tourist scam in Cambodia - Thailand trip. I visited the Hatshepsut temple. I have shared the information about the entry ticket in Hatshepsut temple. I had Koshari, Roz Belaban and Fool in the lunch. So you will see it is not difficult to get the vegetarian food in Egypt. Also, you will see a few crazy Bollywood fans of Egypt. I came back to Luxor train station to catch the train to Cairo. You will also get a glimpse of the coming video in which I am going to show you my train journey from Luxor to Cairo, my experience in Cairo Metro and the famous place in Cairo, Tahrir square.

ABOUT ME
I'm Varun.
I am a full-time traveller now (yes, I quit my job to follow my dreams). I love solo travelling & meeting people. After travelling extensively in Incredible India for years, I stepped out of my country and realised, how beautiful the world is! I started making travel web-series in Hindi with full of travel tips and tricks, especially for budget travel and sustainable tourism. My dream is to inspire people to explore this beautiful world and learn the best things to make our world a better place to live in. I was awarded the prestigious 'National Tourism Award' by the Government of India for my contributions in the field of promotion of Tourism. Thanks to my viewers, because of whom now I get invitations from across the globe to visit their places and show them to the world.

After arriving from Alexandria, I took a bus to Giza Pyramids from a bus terminal inside the city of Giza. Thanks to the helpful people who guided me to the bus terminal. In the initial part of the video, you will see the mad traffic of Giza; you'll get a glimpse local transportation in Egypt. The bus I took to my hotel in Giza is called minibus. I have shared information about the Minibus fare in Cairo and Giza. The person sitting beside me also helped me to understand the mobile service providers in Egypt. So there is a mention of the best mobile network in Egypt. 

The video will also show you the hotel rating scam which I went through. The people, in general, are helpful, but there were few incidents which lead to tourist's harassments. Such events make a tourist feel unsafe in Egypt. In the latter part of the video, you'll find hotels near Giza Pyramids. I stayed in one of them. I got a good view of the pyramids from its rooftop.

This video is about my visit to a Gurudwara in USA. This was my first ever visit to an American Gurudwara. If you are still struggling with what actually a  Gurudwara is, then let me tell you... They are the religious place or the place of worship for the followers of Sikh religion. Watch this video to know how to enter a Gurudwara and how I relished the free meals which are a very noble concept of Gurudwaras. You can also help the Gurudwara by doing different things which I and Rahul did. After this, you will see me struggling to get a ride. I tried to resume my hitchhiking trip in USA. Watch to know whether it is safe to hitchhike at night in USA?

ABOUT ME
I'm Varun.
I am a full-time traveller now (yes, I quit my job to follow my dreams). I love solo travelling & meeting people. After travelling extensively in Incredible India for years, I stepped out of my country and realised, how beautiful the world is! I started making travel web-series in Hindi with full of travel tips and tricks, especially for budget travel and sustainable tourism. My dream is to inspire people to explore this beautiful world and learn the best things to make our world a better place to live in. I was awarded the prestigious 'National Tourism Award' by the Government of India for my contributions in the field of promotion of Tourism. Thanks to my viewers, because of whom now I get invitations from across the globe to visit their places and show them to the world.

ABOUT ME
I'm Varun.
I am a full-time traveller now (yes, I quit my job to follow my dreams). I love solo travelling & meeting people. After travelling extensively in Incredible India for years, I stepped out of my country and realised, how beautiful the world is! I started making travel web-series in Hindi with full of travel tips and tricks, especially for budget travel and sustainable tourism. My dream is to inspire people to explore this beautiful world and learn the best things to make our world a better place to live in. I was awarded the prestigious 'National Tourism Award' by the Government of India for my contributions in the field of promotion of Tourism. Thanks to my viewers, because of whom now I get invitations from across the globe to visit their places and show them to the world.

Besides Bishkek, Karakol, Issyk Kul (lake) which are the most popular destinations in Kyrgyzstan, I visited some offbeat places like Jyrgalan valley, Song Kul (lake). Did horse riding trips, stayed in Yurt camps, hitchhiked and stayed with locals. I volunteered in village farms, hostels and NGOs to get the holistic experience of my trip and central Asian culture. All this you will find In this series. #Kyrgyzstan #IndianTraveller #AviaTraffic

ABOUT ME
I'm Varun.
I am a full-time traveller now (yes, I quit my job to follow my dreams). I love solo travelling & meeting people. After travelling extensively in Incredible India for years, I stepped out of my country and realised, how beautiful the world is! I started making travel web-series in Hindi with full of travel tips and tricks, especially for budget travel and sustainable tourism. My dream is to inspire people to explore this beautiful world and learn the best things to make our world a better place to live in. I was awarded the prestigious 'National Tourism Award' by the Government of India for my contributions in the field of promotion of Tourism. Thanks to my viewers, because of whom now I get invitations from across the globe to visit their places and show them to the world.

This video is based on the 22nd day of my US trip. The day began in Texas and finished at another truck stop in Tonkawa, Oklahoma. I met Mark, an American Trucker in Texas. We had discussions on a number of topics, including a rule which binds the truck driver in the US not to drive more than 11 hours a day. He also shared his experience of before and after this rule. I wish this rule is also implemented in India where everyday we lose almost 400 people in road accidents. He also speaks about his love towards the Hindi language and the Indian people. You will also see another trucker, Sonu, a Punjabi helping me to reach the last point of the day, Tonkawa.

ABOUT ME
I'm Varun.
I am a full-time traveller now (yes, I quit my job to follow my dreams). I love solo travelling & meeting people. After travelling extensively in Incredible India for years, I stepped out of my country and realised, how beautiful the world is! I started making travel web series in Hindi full of travel tips and tricks, especially for budget travel and sustainable tourism. My dream is to inspire people to explore this beautiful world and learn the best things to make our world a better place to live in. I was awarded the prestigious 'National Tourism Award' by the Government of India for my contributions in the field of promotion of Tourism. Thanks to my viewers, because of whom now I get invitations from across the globe to visit their places and show them to the world.

ABOUT ME
I'm Varun.
I am a full-time traveller now (yes, I quit my job to follow my dreams). I love solo travelling & meeting people. After travelling extensively in Incredible India for years, I stepped out of my country and realised, how beautiful the world is! I started making travel web-series in Hindi with full of travel tips and tricks, especially for budget travel and sustainable tourism. My dream is to inspire people to explore this beautiful world and learn the best things to make our world a better place to live in. I was awarded the prestigious 'National Tourism Award' by the Government of India for my contributions in the field of promotion of Tourism. Thanks to my viewers, because of whom now I get invitations from across the globe to visit their places and show them to the world.

This video is based on my visit to Grand Bazar, Istanbul. Watch this to know interesting facts about the Grand Bazaar, which once upon a time had to be the world's largest mall. Thereafter I visited Spice bazar or called Egyptian bazar. Both the markets are quite big and are popular tourist attractions in Istanbul. So I was recommended these places as the must-visit place for a tourist in Istanbul, besides Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque. I met a lot of interesting people on the way. Thereafter I went to Eminonu to catch the ferry to Uskudar. I have shared the process of getting on to the ferry and the free fare to Uskudar. The beginning of the video you will see me visiting a Tourist Information centre in Sultan Ahmet, which I always recommend. The gentleman in the centre helped me to plan the itinerary for Turkey trip.

ABOUT ME
I'm Varun.
I am a full-time traveller now (yes, I quit my job to follow my dreams). I love solo travelling & meeting people. After travelling extensively in Incredible India for years, I stepped out of my country and realised, how beautiful the world is! I started making travel web series in Hindi full of travel tips and tricks, especially for budget travel and sustainable tourism. My dream is to inspire people to explore this beautiful world and learn the best things to make our world a better place to live in. I was awarded the prestigious 'National Tourism Award' by the Government of India for my contributions in the field of promotion of Tourism. Thanks to my viewers, I now get invitations from across the globe to visit their places and show them to the world.

This video is about my first day's experience of visiting Aizawl. I am sharing the information based on several topics. In the beginning, I have shared information regarding the public transport between Lengpui Airport to Aizawl. There are no public buses between the Lengpui airport and Aizawl city. The fare from Lengpui airport to Aizawl in a Sumo starts from 2000 Rs. Check the link for cheaper prepaid taxi fares. touristhelpline.com/visiting-aizawl-mizoram

Thereafter, in the video, I have shared information on the places to stay in Aizawl. There are a lot of private hotels in Aizawl, but I stayed in a Government guest house in Chaltlang, Aizawl. Rooms are available from Rs 600, and on-phone booking is possible. Check the link to get the phone number of Chaltlang tourist lodge. Next topic is related to Best time to visit Mizoram and vegetarian food in Aizawl. After that, I went to experience the public transport in Aizawl. I have shared in the video about Aizawl's minibus fare and taxi fares. Beware of Aizawl's traffic jams. You can also take a bike taxi in Aizawl to dodge the traffic jams. I have shared the bike taxi fare in the link. 

I have also shared my experience with the mobile networks in Aizawl. How Jio, Airtel, BSNL and Vodafone worked for me in Mizoram.

ABOUT ME
I'm Varun.
I am a full-time traveller now (yes, I quit my job to follow my dreams). I love solo travelling & meeting people. After travelling extensively in Incredible India for years, I stepped out of my country and realised, how beautiful the world is! I started making travel web series in Hindi full of travel tips and tricks, especially for budget travel and sustainable tourism. My dream is to inspire people to explore this beautiful world and learn the best things to make our world a better place to live in. I was awarded the prestigious 'National Tourism Award' by the Government of India for my contributions in the field of promotion of Tourism. Thanks to my viewers, because of whom now I get invitations from across the globe to visit their places and show them to the world.

This video is about my journey from Cairo to Delhi. 
This features a small ride in Cairo Metro, where I have shared a few vital information about the Cairo metro fare, Cairo metro map, Cairo metro website, etc. Thereafter I reached Tahrir Square, an iconic place in Cairo. I took a microbus from Cairo to Alexandria. This is possibly the cheapest way to travel from Cairo to Alexandria. Check this video to know the bus fare between Alexandria and Cairo. I have also shared about the cheapest way to travel between Alexandria airport and the downtown Alexandria. It just cost me 27 EGP to reach the Borg El Arab airport from Alexandria city. This will show you the public transportation between the airport and Alexandria city. Then you'll come to know about the so-called facilities available at the Alexandria airport. I landed at the Jeddah airport. Flying between Alexandria and Jeddah with Saudia was not a good experience. Watch this video to know why! 

While at Jeddah, I came to know about a trick to enjoy the long layovers at Jeddah airport. Thanks to Saudia for the good vegeterian meal served during the Jeddah to Delhi flight. Welcome back to India.

This was supposed to be my last day in Turkey, but it seems I was destined to visit some of the most amazing places in Turkey that day. While hitchhiking to the Turkey Georgia border from Savsat to Ardahan, I met another wonderful person who invited me to visit his village. Watch this video to know the interesting story behind my journey. The village I stayed in is called Kocabey köyü in the şavşat district of Artvin province. I visited Karagol lake situated in the Karagol Sahara National park. After that, another lake called Belik Golu, Artvin. The most beautiful part was the hospitality of my host and the people of Kocabey village. Watch this video to see some of the most beautiful landscapes of Turkey.

I crossed the Turkey-Georgia border from Aktas border gate. I tried to record most of the things on camera and have shared crucial information on topics like - Aktas border opening & closing time, Georgia immigration, How to get Georgia visa for Indians considering the high deportation rate of Indians, Georgian currency Lari exchange, etc. After travelling quite a few countries including the USA & Canada, till now this was the most difficult immigration process for me. Watch this video and do not repeat the mistakes I did while immigration and improve your chances of getting an entry in Georgia as a tourist.

While travelling in Toronto using public Transport I came across the most interesting thing which I have shared in detail in this video. 6 people can travel on a single pass in any transportation mode of the TTC system. My day started with a free walk tour from Union Station, Toronto. I came to know about PATH, an underground system which was the most interesting part of the walking tour. Though something happened at the end of the tour which was not a pleasant experience. Then I visited the Royal Ontario Museum by using Toronto's public transport. After that, I took a Street Car to China Town. Had dim sum at one of the Chinese restaurants in Chinatown Toronto. The day ended with the Art gallery of Ontario which was very close to my hotel Chelsea.

ABOUT ME
I'm Varun.
I am a full-time traveller now (yes, I quit my job to follow my dreams). I love solo travelling & meeting people. After travelling extensively in Incredible India for years, I stepped out of my country and realised, how beautiful the world is! I started making travel web-series in Hindi with full of travel tips and tricks, especially for budget travel and sustainable tourism. My dream is to inspire people to explore this beautiful world and learn the best things to make our world a better place to live in. I was awarded the prestigious 'National Tourism Award' by the Government of India for my contributions in the field of promotion of Tourism. Thanks to my viewers, because of whom now I get invitations from across the globe to visit their places and show them to the world.

This is based on my Air India flight from Kolkata to Bangkok. I have shared the reasons for flying with Air India. Though there are many budget airlines for Thailand from India, cons like limited leg space, no free checked-in luggage, no complimentary in-flight food, etc are some points which will make you rethink before you buy a budget flight ticket to Thailand. I have highlighted a few things about Air India which may help especially an Indian tourist. Watch Air India's flight review and decide it is still the worst or best airline in India connecting Thailand. #AirIndia #BangkokFlight #KolkatatoBangkok

Based on the experiences I had while visiting Gallipoli. Thanks to my Couchsurfing host in Gallipoli because of whom I could see the town. Gallipoli has got a great significance in the history of India. During World War 1 thousands of Indian soldiers fought in Gallipoli for their British rulers. On the opposite side were the soldiers of the erstwhile Ottoman Empire. My host was a teacher and took me to his school. I met a lot of teachers and we interacted on a lot of topics. I came to know that Aamir Khan’s ‘Taare Zameen Par’ or ‘Every Child is Special’, as it is known in Turkey is a very popular movie. The Government of Turkey advice teachers in Turkey to watch Taare Zameen Par. During the whole trip, I found Aamir Khan is very popular in Turkey. Thanks to Bollywood for making us popular in Turkey.

ABOUT ME
I'm Varun.
I am a full-time traveller now (yes, I quit my job to follow my dreams). I love solo travelling & meeting people. After travelling extensively in Incredible India for years, I stepped out of my country and realised, how beautiful the world is! I started making travel web-series in Hindi with full of travel tips and tricks, especially for budget travel and sustainable tourism. My dream is to inspire people to explore this beautiful world and learn the best things to make our world a better place to live in. I was awarded the prestigious 'National Tourism Award' by the Government of India for my contributions in the field of promotion of Tourism. Thanks to my viewers, because of whom now I get invitations from across the globe to visit their places and show them to the world.

I had a terrible experience in Serbia when I rented a car at Belgrade Airport. Based on what happened, I can say the worst car agency at Belgrade airport is ‘AR Rent a Car’. Watch this video and you’ll come to know about the things you must know before renting a car anywhere in the world. How rental agencies try to trap their customers. So go through my experience to avoid such tourist scams while travelling.  

This video is a part of travel web series based on my trip to Serbia. I travelled from Delhi to Belgrade via Dubai availing the visa-free entry for Indians in Serbia for 30 days. Watch all the videos in sequence here http://bit.ly/MTserbia2020. #TouristScam #Serbia #IndianinSerbia

ABOUT ME
I'm Varun.
I am a full-time traveller now (yes, I quit my job to follow my dreams). I love solo travelling & meeting people. After travelling extensively in Incredible India for years, I stepped out of my country and realised, how beautiful the world is! I started making travel web-series in Hindi with full of travel tips and tricks, especially for budget travel. My dream is to inspire people to explore this beautiful world and learn the best things to make our world a better place to live in. I was awarded the prestigious 'National Tourism Award' by the Government of India for my contributions in the field of promotion of Tourism. Thanks to my viewers, because of whom now I get invitations from across the globe to visit their places and show them to the world.
