They need good winter snow for the grass to grow well during the summers. But too much snowfall can create  trouble for them by burying the grass necessary for the survival of their animals.

A winter storm is the worst nightmare for the Changpas. And on the 3rd week of my living with the Changpas a winter storm is exactly what we got.

1,UC0EWL3FL95mgUPUtlFwu2bw,kJB-twGLqvg,2018-12-04T16:28:21Z,A Shepherd's Journey (with English Subtitles),"This short film follows Narender Kaith, a Gaddi shepherd from the Kaobil village in the Shimla district of Himachal Pradesh. Every year he and his fellow Gaddis take a herd of around 1500 sheep and goats across the Bhabha pass from the Kinnaur region of Himachal Pradesh to Spiti. This video is about his life, his journey and the difficulties faced along the way.

I spent about 40 days travelling with the shepherds to make this video. Meeting Narender in the Bhabha valley was a completely random coincidence and I thank my lucky stars for that meeting. We were not that well acquainted on our onward journey from the Bhabha Valley to the Pin Valley. I was camping a bit away from the shepherds and cooking my own food. But we became much closer on the return journey and I was soon eating, sleeping and living in their camps. I was following truly in the footsteps of the nomads!

Life is tough here, but also very beautiful. Even the mundane day to day activities look spectacular in the winter setting. The people, restricted to their homes in the winters, are both cheerful and industrious. They wisely spend their winter downtime by performing various activities and chores that they just woundn't have the time for in the summer months. 

In this episode we will see how the people of Todnam prepare for and live their lives during the harsh winters in Pin Valley.

Crops do not grow at these high altitudes, so the Changpas survive by raising goats and yaks. It is a hard life as they spend almost every moment days taking care of their animals and processing their produce. 


In this episode we will see what a typical day of a Changpa is like during the winters. Everything from their activities at home, in the village and out in the plains with their animals.

However, I left out the best reason of all. The people of Spiti. The kindest and most hospitable bunch that I've met in my travels. 

I spent 60 days, traveling across Spiti to make these videos. I was out of money for pretty much the entire duration. So I hiked and camped everywhere and the people were so so nice about it. 

I lost count of the number of times I was invited into their homes for a cup or tea, lunch, dinner and even a place to sleep without expecting anything in return. I was and still am touched by their kindness. This video is dedicated to the people of Spiti. Hope it inspires more travellers to experience the warmth and kindness prevalent in the Spiti valley.

I was very hesitant to travel anywhere during this pandemic. The last thing I wanted was to be an unwitting carrier and spread the virus to such remote places. So I tried to be as careful as possible and got permission from the concerned authorities as well as the local people before traveling anywhere. A lot of gratitude to all my friends who helped me on this trip.

Many thanks to Tsewang Dorjay from the Lingtse guesthouse in Leh. Lingtse has been my base for the last 3 winters in Ladakh. And Dorjay is one of the most genuine, helpful people that I have met on my travels. He was of immense help this winter, introducing me to locals from Zanskar, arranging interviews with monks and scholars in Leh, translating the interviews etc. I wholeheartedly recommend him for all your travel needs in Ladakh. You can reach him at  9906986664.

Also many thanks to Lobsang Wangtak from Stongde, Zanskar. He is a filmmaker and a social entrepreneur working to provide sustainable solutions for the challenges facing Zanskar. He is currently working on  water-lift project to irrigate the village of Pischu. The same village where I spent over 35 days recovering from my frostbite. You can find more about his project on his website. 

https://navikarana.org/

Finally, many thanks to Ven.Thupstan Paldan for patiently answering my questions about Ladakh and Zanskar. Ven.Thupstan Paldan is a renowned scholar in Ladakh and is the author of 'A Guide to the Buddhist Monasteries and Royal Castles of Ladakh'. One of the best books I have read about the Buddhist culture of Ladakh.

Two people returning from Iran tested positive for the virus and that put all of Ladakh into high alert.

The authorities moved quickly. The infected people and their whole village was put under quarantine immediately.  People started wearing masks everywhere. Even the very popular Matho Nargrang festival hardly had any visitors after the news broke out. The local administration even stopped issuing inner line permits to prevent the virus from spreading to the remote villages of Ladakh.

All this put me in a dilemma on whether to stay back or leave. I was in the process of making a short film about the Matho Nagrang festival and there was a ceremony on April 2nd which I was keen on covering. Moreover, the sparsely populated villages of Ladakh should be safer from the virus than the crowded cities of the plains. But I also had aging parents at home to think about. So I decided to stay back in Ladakh till the ceremony and head home immediately after that.

I booked my tickets for April 4th and headed to the mountains behind the Matho village to camp and self isolate myself from the virus. It was the best way to protect myself and also people with whom I was staying with in Leh.

I spent 6 nights camping in the mountains. I could have stayed longer but I was running low on fuel and also was anxious for some news from home. So I went down towards the village and the news I heard from my family and friends about the virus was not very encouraging. So I returned back to Leh the next morning and flew out on the 24’th of March.

It is reachable only by a 10km trek across steep mountain trails which are buried by snow and avalanches during the winter months. And the only way to access Itcho in winter is by walking on the frozen Phu Lungma stream, making it  a Chadar trek experience like no other.

They are devout buddhists, all of them. But while Buddhism preaches non-violence towards all living creatures, the Changpas raise their animals to be killed and sold off for meat. 

So their lives are bit of a paradox and in this episode we will see how the Changpas try and balance these 2 aspects of their lives through prayers and rituals.

Each tribe has their own set of grazing areas for different times of the year. They migrate between these places every few weeks, taking all their animals, their families and most of their belongings with them. The migration of the Changpas is quite the spectacle and I was fortunate enough to witness the most amazing spectacle of them all. A winter migration of the Changpas.

But then I arrived in Leh to find a very dry landscape bereft of any snow. It hadn't snowed at all that winter and everyone was bit worried about the changing weather.

I was worried as well, for my own selfish reasons. I needed snow for my time-lapse videos. What happened next? 

This video is part of my 'Behind the Timelapse' series giving you a glimpse into the making of my time-lapse videos. It is the first time I'am doing something like this. So any tips and suggestions are always welcome.

Here is the first instalment towards fulfilling that goal. A time lapse showcase of Ladakh. I spent 3 months in Ladakh (6 weeks in Autumn and 6 weeks in the Winter) shooting these videos.

I do this on a shoe string budget. Spending around 300 Rupees (~5$) a day. In Autumn, I traveled around Ladakh on my motorbike and in the Winter I hiked and hitchhiked my way through this wonderful land. It was a lot of fun!. I camp a lot, both to minimize costs and to be at the right location at the right time, and stay in village homestays wherever I can. The warmth and generosity of the Ladakhi hospitality is an inspiration for all of us to emulate.

Puga is located in the Changthang (High Altitude Plains) area of Ladakh. It is one of the coldest places in Ladakh but not as remote or extreme like Tsomoriri or Tsokar. So I wanted to experience winter camping in Puga before going to camp in the more extreme places.

This video is part of my 'Behind the Timelapse' series giving you a glimpse into the making of my time-lapse videos. It is the first time I'am doing something like this. So any tips and suggestions are always welcome.

Also known as the Spiti Pony, it is one of the 6 recognised horse breeds of India. What makes the Chamurti  special is that it is one of the few natural “pacers” in the horse world. It trots side to side on its laterals rather than diagonals enabling the rider to sit comfortably for hours at a time.

Almost every family in Pin Valley is involved in the Chamurti business. The villagers work together as a community to raise these horses in typical Pin valley fashion.

Personally, I feel that places such as Todnam should remain pure and untouched by tourism. But the villagers feel otherwise and feel left out of the tourism boom that places like Mudh experience. It is not really my place to stand in the way of their aspirations. 

If you like to visit Todnam then please get in touch with my friend Nawang Tanzin. It is his dream to open the first homestay in the village. His number is 94186 02537. This is the most I can do and I feel guilty for doing this. Please do not comment/message me asking for more details about the village.",116478,2094,132

--------------------

This is my first attempt at making a documentary style video. I've been wanting to make such videos for a long time but getting the interviews was always my achilles heel.

Even here, I managed to get the interview 2 months after the festival was over. Ideally I should have done the opposite. And as a result I did not cover many of the important ceremonies in the festival. It is a learning process after all and hopefully I'll do better the next time.

While not as big as the lakes in Ladakh, ChandraTal is definitely one of the most beautiful lakes I have seen. 

Because of its small size the water in the lake is perfectly still when there is no wind. The entire lake is like a well polished mirror reflecting the peaks and glaciers of the magnificent Chandra - Bhaga mountain range. I camped for 2 days next to the lake to capture these time-lapse images.

The main source of entertainment back in the day were the plays performed by Buzhen lamas and the Da Chang or archery competitions. The Buzhen lama tradition has almost died down in the recent years but Dachang is still held all over Spiti and Pin Valley during the winter months. It brings people together and gives them a chance to break the winter monotony. And more importantly it is a lot of fun!

Personally, I feel that places such as Todnam should remain pure and untouched by tourism. But the villagers feel otherwise and feel left out of the tourism boom that places like Mudh experience. It is not really my place to stand in the way of their aspirations. 

If you like to visit Todnam then please get in touch with my friend Nawang Tanzin. It is his dream to open the first homestay in the village. His number is 94186 02537. This is the most I can do and I feel guilty for doing this. Please do not comment/message me asking for more details about the village.",73620,1742,178

72,UC0EWL3FL95mgUPUtlFwu2bw,marG44v_2eo,2017-05-03T19:06:10Z,Winter in Ladakh - Timelapse,"Treat yourself to a visual journey across the winter landscapes of Ladakh. Witness scenes very few people have witnessed in real life.

I spent 2 winters (2015 & 2017) in Ladakh in search of these visuals. About 4 months of hiking, hitchhiking and camping across Ladakh in freezing winds and numbing cold. It was difficult but I also enjoyed the experience. A lot of numb fingers and toes at the end of it all. Be sure to check out the behind scenes videos which would soon follow.

73,UC0EWL3FL95mgUPUtlFwu2bw,ifubq1rIKy8,2017-01-08T19:08:15Z,First snowfall in Manali - Winter 2017,"A short video of the 2017 winter season's first snowfall in Manali. 

It has been a very long wait for this year's snowfall in Manali. The last rainfall in Manali was way back in August 2016 and then it has been a prolonged dry spell in Manali and the neighbouring villages. Forest fires were common during the autumn season and even a few house caught fire during the dry spell.

The local villagers were worried that it would be a repeat of the 2016 winter with very little snowfall. But thankfully all their prayers were answered and it started raining on July 6th. Raining mind you in January. Usually it snows here by the end of November. But the ground here was so dry and hot that it rained for one whole day before the snow started falling in the evening. And like they say, when it rains it pours. And it snowed and snowed and snowed. Almost 3 foot of snow over 3 days.

I made this short video while going to catch a bus to Delhi. The roads were slick with snow and buses and cars started slipping and going off the road. So instead of starting in Manali all the tourist buses started from Pathlikul, around 25km from Manali. I walked for 5 hours and rode in a car for 2 hours before finally catching my bus to Delhi!.

WARNING:
Please note that winter hiking in Spiti could be extremely dangerous due to heavy snowfall and avalanches. I planned my hikes around summer hamlets called Dogris which are located at a short distance (5 to 10km) from the villages and are safe from avalanches. And the villagers also regularly visit these hamlets during winters to clear snow from the roof of their summer homes. So there is a clear trail to these places. 

Also I always checked the weather forecast before venturing out. Please follow all safety precautions and check the latest rules and regulations with the local authorities before heading out.

Chabdika Devi is joined by the Ormic Shu Devta from the Moorang village and the Shangche Kyun and Meka Kyun Devtas from the Nesang village.

Together they go to the Pangrang Mata temple above the Nesang village. Where the priests perform sacred rituals which open a portal to the Ropa Valley across the Sutlej river.

Tso(lake) - Kar(salt) literally translates into 'Salt Lake' and it is one of the 3 high altitude (salt) lakes in Ladakh.

The Tsokar lake has less water compared to the Pangong and Tsomoriri lakes, but it makes up for it by the sheer expanse of wetlands and marshes that surround the lake. In my opinion this is the most interesting of all the lakes in Ladakh and i hope that my video would go some way towards shoring up my opinion.

During summers these horses are allowed to roam free in the mountains. But they are supervised by a couple of herders from the village who round up the horses every day into a large pen to ensure that predators do not attack the young foals. I found the entire process of rearing these horse very interesting and currently collecting footage to make a short film about it. This video can be considered as a preview of what is to come.
