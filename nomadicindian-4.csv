http://bit.ly/NomadicIndian

Website:- http://www.shaolin.org.cn/en/

Hello Guys,

Since childhood, I wanted to visit this place. After watching those Chinese & Hollywood movies Shaolin Temple or Shaolin Kung Fu became a bucket list.


The Shaolin Monastery also is known as the Shaolin Temple, is a Chan Buddhism temple in Dengfeng, Henan Province, China. Believed to have been founded in the fifth century, the Shaolin Temple is the main temple of the Shaolin school of Buddhism to this day.

Located 90 kilometres west of the city of Zhengzhou, the Shaolin Monastery and its Pagoda Forest at Shaolin Temple were inscribed as a World Heritage Site in 2010 as part of the ""Dengfeng.""

In 495 AD, Shaolin temple was built among the Song mountains in Henan province. The first monk who preached Buddhism there was the Indian monk named Buddhabhadra, simply called Batuo by the Chinese. There are historical records that Batuo's first Chinese disciples, Huiguang and Sengchou, both had exceptional martial skills. For example, Sengchou's stability with the tin staff is even documented in the Chinese Buddhist canon. After Buddhabadra, the monk Bodhidharma, described as either Central Asian or Indian and simply called Damo by the Chinese, came to Shaolin in 527 AD. His Chinese disciple, Huike, was also a highly trained martial arts expert. There are hints that these first three Chinese Shaolin monks, Huiguang, Sengchou, and Huike, may have been military men before entering the monastic life.

http://bit.ly/NomadicIndian

Hello Guys,

In this video, I have shared my experience of long-distance trains in China. Train travel is the primary method of long-distance transportation for the Chinese, with an extensive network of routes covering most of the country. Roughly a quarter of the world's total rail traffic is in China.
China now has the world's largest network of high-speed railways (similar to French TGV or Japanese Shinkansen bullet trains), the CRH trains, and expansion continues at a frantic pace. If your route and budget allow then these may be the best way to get around.
Hong Kong has a high-speed rail station that opened to the public in 2018. Macau has no rail connection at all, although Zhuhai over the border is connected to a high-speed line.

Zhangjiajie is a prefecture-level city in the northwestern part of Hunan province, People's Republic of China. It comprises the district of Yongding, Wulingyuan and counties of Cili and Sangzhi. Within it is located Wulingyuan Scenic Area which was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1992 as well as an AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration.
It was renamed to its present name in January 2010 for having served as inspiration for the ""Hallelujah Mountains"" in the film Avatar, as well as to show appreciation to the social message present therein. Previously, it was known as the Southern Sky Column.

Hello Guys,

This was my last day of Afghanistan, and there were lots of places which were left from my to-do list, but in the end, I decided to meet the Sikh & Hindu community of Afghanistan, Kabul. Due to the current situation of the country, things are really different for the minorities in Afghanistan. Although the government of Afghanistan is really trying to protect their rights with the current environment of Afghanistan, it is tough. I visited some Gurudwaras & Hindu temples in Kabul so that I can get a closer look at the lifestyle of Hindus & Sikhs.

Hello Guys,

Kabul - The capital of Afghanistan. After exploring Kabul during day time, it was time for dinner & street hoping in Kabul during the evening. I must say, I was surprised after seeing the night scene & streets. The first thing they were clean as compare to India, and it doesn’t look like Afghanistan, which I have seen on television or newspapers.  We were roaming around the streets till 11:30pm, and everything was normal. We went for kebabs, Icecream & for some other food. It really was an enjoyable experience for me.

http://bit.ly/NomadicIndian

Range Rover Video:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUwzWHD3Htg&t=227s

Hello Guys,

Tianmen Mountain, meaning Heaven's Gate Mountain, is a mountain located within Tianmen Mountain National Park, Zhangjiajie, in the northwestern part of Hunan Province, China.

A cablecar was constructed in 2005[1] by the French company Poma from nearby Zhangjiajie railway station to the top of the mountain. Tianmen Mountain Cableway is claimed in tourist publications as the ""longest passenger cableway of high mountains in the world"", with 98 cars and a total length of 7,455 m (24,459 ft) and the ascent of 1,279 m (4,196 ft). The highest gradient is 37 degrees. Tourists can walk on kilometres of paths built along the cliff face at the top of the mountain, including sections with glass floors. An 11 km (7 mi) road with 99 bends also reaches the top of the mountain and takes visitors to Tianmen cave, a natural arch in the mountain of a height of 131.5 m.
China's Tianmen Shan cable car is the longest cable car ride in the world, covering a distance of 7,455 meters. The car runs from Zhangjiajie downtown up to Tianmen Shan, which translates as ""Heaven's Gate Mountain.""
Once you arrive you get to witness towering cliffs, karst caves and rare sub-tropical forests.
The steepest section of the trail reaches a climbing angle of 38 degrees. By comparison, the world standard for cable car maximum climbing angle is 45 degrees.

In this video, I have shared my experience of visiting Dawki - Jaflong border of India and Bangladesh from Bangladesh's side. 
Bangladesh and India share a 4,096-kilometre-long international border, the fifth-longest land border in the world, including 262 km  in Assam, 856 km  in Tripura, 318 km in Mizoram, 443 km in Meghalaya, and 2,217 km  in West Bengal. The Bangladeshi divisions of Mymensingh, Khulna, Rajshahi, Rangpur, Sylhet, and Chittagong are situated along the border. A number of pillars mark the border between the two states. Small demarcated portions of the border are fenced on both sides.

Northeast is my favorite part of our country & Its really and that sometimes we forgot them & start discriminating with them.
Through this video I'm not insulting anyone or any community, I'm just raising the issue so that we can stop these kind of things.

Hello Guys,
In this video, I have shared my experience of Rickshaws of Dhaka Bangladesh. According to some estimate, there are over more than one million Rickshaws in Bangladesh.
Rickshaw one of the principal means of transport in the urban areas of Bangladesh. With the improvement of road communication throughout the country, rickshaw has now found its way into rural areas as well.
The Dhaka city had only 37 rickshaws in 1941 and 181 rickshaws in 1947. Before 1947, Dhaka was a district town, which had a population of 62,469 only according to 1951 census. But in 1998, the city's population grew over 8 million and the number of registered rickshaws in the city was 112,572. The number of rickshaws in all other cities of Bangladesh in that year was 274,265 and in all villages 91,040

In this video, I have shared my experience of floating on the Dead Sea. I visited the Jordanian side of the Dead sea.
The Dead Sea is a salt lake bordered by Jordan to the east and Israel and the West Bank to the west. It lies in the Jordan Rift Valley, and its main tributary is the Jordan River. The lake's surface is 430.5 metres below sea level, making its shores the lowest land-based elevation on Earth.

Hello Guys,

"" Do you think about how it will end? "" I ask this same question to a lot of Afghani & answers were really disturbing. Some of them are quite hopeful, but most of them are saying "" NEVER "". Afghanistan has seen a lot of wars & it has become a regular thing for them, but still, there is some hope. 
In this video, we have visited the grave of Afghan NAtional war hero "" Massoud "" in his early days he fought against the Soviet Union & in his last days, he was fighting against Taliban.

In this video, I have used music from Epidemic sounds.

The Romani, also known as Roma, are an Indo-Aryan people, traditionally nomadic itinerants living mostly in Europe, as well as diaspora populations in the Americas. The Romani are widely known in English by the exonym Gypsies (or Gipsies), which is considered by some Roma people to be pejorative due to its connotations of illegality and irregularity.

Linguistic and genetic evidence suggests that the Romani as a people originated from the northern Indian subcontinent. They are dispersed, but their most concentrated populations are located in Europe, especially Central, Eastern and Southern Europe (including Turkey, Spain and Southern France). The Romani arrived in Mid-West Asia and Europe around 1007.

Since the 19th century, some Romani have also migrated to the Americas. There are an estimated one million Roma in the United States; and 800,000 in Brazil, most of whose ancestors emigrated in the 19th century from Eastern Europe. Brazil also includes a notable Romani community descended from people deported by the Portuguese Empire during the Portuguese Inquisition. In migrations since the late 19th century, Romani have also moved to other countries in South America and to Canada.

If you want to explore Tlabung, you can contact:- Kirabaran Chakma +917627914651

Hello Guys,

In this video, I have explored the border of India & Bangladesh. This the most complicated border between India & Bangladesh. There is a free movement of people from both sides of the border. The condition of life is not such a good ion these parts of region they don't even have some basic necessities like road, gas, connectivity & education. They have to travel long distance on their boats.

The Chakma people are a native group from the eastern-most regions of the Indian subcontinent, they are the largest ethnic group in the Chittagong Hill Tracts region in southeastern Bangladesh, and in Mizoram, India (Chakma Autonomous District Council), they are the second-largest ethnic group. In Tripura, India, they are the fourth largest ethnic group and having a sizable population in other parts of Northeast India, such as, 40-50 thousand Chakmas in Arunachal Pradesh, India, who migrated there in 1964 after the Kaptai dam tragedy, and 20-30 thousand Chakmas are in Assam, India. Their ethnicity is closely linked with the peoples of East Asia. However, the Chakma language is part of the Indo-Aryan language family of the Indian subcontinent. Most Chakma people are adherents of Therevada Buddhism. The Chakmas are divided into 46 clans or Gozas.

There are 5-6 types of tribal people live in this area. Chakma, Mizo, Bodo, etc. The primary market of Tlabung hosts a Bangladeshi tribal market in which people from nearby villages comes to buy & sell their product. Their primary mode of transport is boats.

In this video, I have shared my Experience of crossing the Brahmaputra river in Bangladesh near to India ( Assam ) border.
The Brahmaputra, also known as the Yarlung Tsangpo in Tibet, the Siang/Dihang River in Arunachal Pradesh, and Luit, Dilao in Assam, is a trans-boundary river which flows through Tibet, India, and Bangladesh. It is the 9th largest river in the world by discharge, and the 15th longest. 
The Ganges Delta (also known as the Sundarbans Delta or the Bengal Delta is a river delta in the Bengal region of South Asia, consisting of Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal. It is the world's largest river delta and it empties into the Bay of Bengal with the combined waters of several river systems, mainly those of the Brahmaputra river and the Ganges river. It is also one of the most fertile regions in the world, thus earning the nickname the Green Delta. The delta stretches from the Hooghly River east as far as the Meghna River.

Hello Guys,

In this video, I have shared my experience from Samangan, Afghanistan. We went to an old Buddhist site which was built during the 3-4 century AD. There is a stupa, some caves and a Baazar from that period. As an ancient town and major Buddhist centre during the 4th and 5th centuries under the then Kushan rulers, it has the ruins of that period at a place known now as Takht-i-Rustam, which is located on a hill above the town.

One of the most amazing & surprising days of my Sri Lankan trip :) While I was exploring Jaffna, Sri Lanka I met two female solo travellers & one them was from Ambala ( India ), and it really was the most surprising thing from my entire Sri Lankan trip. No, I was not surprised because she was Indian, I was surprised because of her age, she was just nineteen & she was travelling by on her own, that's a massive achievement in our society.

Hello Guys,

I don't know how to express this feeling, I'm visiting Pakistan, the country which use to be a part of our country, but somehow we were divided into two pieces & since then nothing is going in a right direction. We have fought three wars & still, there were no excellent results.
Recently, India & Pakistan signed a treaty on the Kartarpur Corridor. The Kartarpur Corridor is a travel free Border crossing and secure corridor, connecting the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Pakistan to Pakistan_border with India. The pass allows devotees from India to visit the gurdwara in Kartarpur, Pakistan, 4.7 kilometres (2.9 miles) from the Pakistan_border without a visa, creating a link which allows pilgrims holding Indian passports to easily visit both the Kartarpur shrine and Dera Baba Nanak on the Indian side of the border. Pakistani Sikhs are unable to use the border crossing, and cannot access the Gurdwara Dera Baba Nanak without first obtaining an Indian visa.

http://bit.ly/NomadicIndian
If you want to explore Tlabung, you can contact:- Kirabaran Chakma +917627914651

Hello Guys,

In this video, I have explored the Wild Mizoram near to Bangaladesh Border. Tlabung is situated near to Bangladesh border. The condition of life is not such a good ion these parts of region they don't even have some basic necessities like road, gas, connectivity & education. They have to travel long distance on their boats.
The Chakma people are a native group from the eastern-most regions of the Indian subcontinent, they are the largest ethnic group in the Chittagong Hill Tracts region in southeastern Bangladesh, and in Mizoram, India (Chakma Autonomous District Council), they are the second-largest ethnic group. In Tripura, India, they are the fourth largest ethnic group and having a sizable population in other parts of Northeast India, such as, 40-50 thousand Chakmas in Arunachal Pradesh, India, who migrated there in 1964 after the Kaptai dam tragedy, and 20-30 thousand Chakmas are in Assam, India. Their ethnicity is closely linked with the peoples of East Asia. However, the Chakma language is part of the Indo-Aryan language family of the Indian subcontinent. Most Chakma people are adherents of Therevada Buddhism. The Chakmas are divided into 46 clans or Gozas.

There are 5-6 types of tribal people live in this area. Chakma, Mizo, Bodo, etc. The primary market of Tlabung hosts a Bangladeshi tribal market in which people from nearby villages comes to buy & sell their product. Their primary mode of transport is boats.

In this video, I have shared my experience of Terracotta Warriors of Xi'an, China. The Terracotta Army in Xi'an, aka Terracotta Warriors and Horses, is a super large collection of life-size terra cotta sculptures in battle formations, reproducing the mega imperial guard troops of Emperor Qin Shi Huang (259 - 210BC), the first emperor of the first unified dynasty of Imperial China.

Being the most significant archaeological excavations of the 20th century and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Terracotta Army is no doubt a must-see for every visitor to Xi'an.

Originally the ancient funerary project for Emperor Qin Shi Huang, the Terracotta Warriors China are now displayed in a live museum built on the site, officially named Emperor Qinshihuang's Mausoleum Site Museum, showing the life stories of the emperor and the once-powerful Qin Empire (221 – 207BC) in those days of pomp and vigor. Terracotta Soldiers are Taller Than Modern People.

45,UCgilhqoyZrXV2EBlaaAtVaw,Mb3YGb4o-Vk,2022-09-08T04:47:00Z,VISITING RAMSETU from SRI LANKA SIDE,"Rama's Bridge or Rama Setu, is a chain of natural limestone shoals, between Pamban Island, also known as Rameswaram Island, off the south-eastern coast of Tamil Nadu, India, and Mannar Island, off the north-western coast of Sri Lanka. Geological evidence suggests that this bridge is a former land connection between India and Sri Lanka.[2]

The feature is 48 km (30 mi) long and separates the Gulf of Mannar (southwest) from the Palk Strait (northeast). Some of the regions are dry, and the sea in the area rarely exceeds 1 metre (3 ft) in depth, thus hindering navigation. It was reportedly passable on foot until the 15th century when storms deepened the channel. Ramanathaswamy Temple records say that Ram Setu was entirely above sea level until it broke in a cyclone in 1480.

According to legends, Ram setu Bridge was constructed by Lord Ram when he went to Sri Lanka to save Sita mata from Sri Lankan king Raavan. In Sri Lanka people also call this bridge as Hanuman Bridge. This is also mentioned in Ramayan.

Hello Guys,

In this video, I have shared my experience of an Armenian family in Jordan. They invited me for lunch & we talked about a lot of things. I didn't expect this in Jordan that, I'll be having lunch with an Armenian family. Armenians in Jordan are ethnic Armenians living within the current Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. There are an estimated 3,000 Armenians living in the country today with an estimated 2,500 of them being members of the Armenian Apostolic Church and predominantly speak Western Armenian dialect. Armenians make up the biggest majority of non-Arab Christians in the country.

In this video, I have shared my experience of traveling in the trains of Saudi Arabia. Trains of Saudi Arbai are fascinating & amazing. The Saudi Railways Organization (SRO) (Arabic: المؤسسة العامة للخطوط الحديدية) is one of two state-owned companies that operates Saudi Arabia's rail network along with Saudi Railway Company. The SRO operates a network of railways with a total length of approximately 1,380 kilometers. The network consists of two main lines. A 449 km passenger line that links Dammam with Riyadh, and a 556 km freight line that connects the King Abdul Aziz Port in Dammam with Riyadh.

Saudi Arabia, officially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, is a country on the Arabian Peninsula in Western Asia. It has a land area of about 2,150,000 km², making it the third-largest country entirely in Asia, the second-largest in the Arab world, and the largest in Western Asia.

http://bit.ly/NomadicIndian

Hello Guys,

In this video, I have shared my experience of long-distance trains in China. Train travel is the primary method of long-distance transportation for the Chinese, with an extensive network of routes covering most of the country. Roughly a quarter of the world's total rail traffic is in China.
China now has the world's largest network of high-speed railways (similar to French TGV or Japanese Shinkansen bullet trains), the CRH trains, and expansion continues at a frantic pace. If your route and budget allow then these may be the best way to get around.
Hong Kong has a high-speed rail station that opened to the public in 2018. Macau has no rail connection at all, although Zhuhai over the border is connected to a high-speed line.

Hello Guys,
In this video, I have shared my experience of exploring Medina as a Hindu. Medina, officially Al Madinah Al Munawwarah  and also commonly simplified as Madīnah or Madinah (المدينة, al-Madina, Hejazi pronunciation:  is the second-holiest city in Islam and the capital of the Medina Province of Saudi Arabia. As of 2020, the estimated population of the city is 1,488,782,[2] making it the fourth-most populous city in the country.[3] Located at the core of the Medina Province in the western reaches of the country, the city is distributed over 589 square KM (227 sq mi), of which 293 square kilometres (113 sq mi) constitutes the city's urban area, while the rest is occupied by the Hejaz Mountains, empty valleys, agricultural spaces and older dormant volcanoes.

In this video, I have shared my experience of dancing at an Uzbek wedding. I was hitchhiking in northern Uzbekistan in Ayder Kul lake & while hitchhiking some people invited me for a wedding.
The people of Uzbekistan are so incredible & the love they show towards Indians is on another level. The moment you say that "" I'm from India "" use baad toh sab mast hai.
After attending the wedding, I also explored the village. This was my time when I was exploring the villages of Uzbekistan.

In this video, I have shared my experience of exploring the capital of Saudi Arabia. Riyadh, Saudi Arabia’s capital and main financial hub, is on a desert plateau in the country’s center
Boulevard Riyadh city is one of the biggest zones in the season. Triple in size this year, each of the sub-areas features its own set of activities, restaurants, events, and outlets that are catered to all visitors
 Business district landmarks include the 302m-high Kingdom Centre, with a sky bridge connecting 2 towers, and 267m-high Al Faisaliah Centre, with a glass-globe summit. In the historical Deira district, Masmak Fort marks the site of the 1902 raid that gave the Al Sauds control of Riyadh.

Saudi Arabia, officially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, is a country on the Arabian Peninsula in Western Asia. It has a land area of about 2,150,000 km², making it the third-largest country entirely in Asia, the second-largest in the Arab world, and the largest in Western Asia.

Click here to support my channel:
http://bit.ly/2JoDUWb

One of the best days of life, as you all know from the last video, I have reached in Murkonglesk ( Last Railway Station of India ).
Murkonglesk in situated in Assam on the border of Assam & Arunachal Pradesh. There are to towns, one is Murkonglesk & another one is Ruksin which is Arunachal Pradesh, one situated on another side of the road and the second one on the other side.
Most of you guys have heard about the ILP ( Inner Line Permit ) its a permission which you are going to need when you will enter in Arunachal Pradesh. You can easily get this permission in the ADC office of Ruksin ( Arunachal Pradesh) you just need an ID proof, 2 photos & 50 Rs.

On this day, I have hitchhiked in Arunachal Pradesh for almost 160 Kms & it took me around 8 hours to complete this journey and it is one of the most dangerous roads of India & at the end, I have made it to a Tribal village, where I have stayed with the Adi Tribe of Arunachal Pradesh.
Riga Village, the biggest village of Arunachal Pradesh & Adi tribe.

( North East India & Arunachal Pradesh )

In this video, I have shared my experiences of visiting a central Baazar of Tashkent ( Charsu Baazar ) People of Uzbekistan are really amazing, I'm so amazed by the hospitality of Uzbekistan. After experiencing the Charsu bazaar, I went to the ISKCON temple ( Hare Krishna) of Tashkent.

The organization was formed to spread the practice of Bhakti yoga, the practice of love of God in which those involved (bhaktas) dedicate their thoughts and actions towards pleasing Krishna, whom they consider the Supreme Lord. Its most rapid expansions in membership as of 2007 have been within India and especially after the collapse of the Soviet Union, in Russia and the rest of the formerly Soviet-aligned states of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.

Click here to support my channel:
http://bit.ly/2JoDUWb

In this video, I have shared my journey from Guwahati to Dibrugarh. It took me almost 12 hours to Complete this journey.
Dibrugarh is a city and is the headquarters of the Dibrugarh district in the state of Assam in India. Well known as the Tea City of India, Dibrugarh is considered to be a major city in eastern India in line with Guwahati and Bhubaneswar and is the emerging communication and industrial hub of North East India. Dibrugarh is also one of the two main cities in the state of Assam to receive urban development aid from the Asian Development Bank and is the nerve centre of industry, communication and healthcare of the upper Assam region. Dibrugarh is located 439 km (273 miles) east of Guwahati, the largest city of the Indian state of Assam. Dibrugarh is well connected to the rest of India by rail, road and air transport and thus serves as a gateway to eastern Assam and also parts of Arunachal Pradesh. Moreover, there has also been a consistent demand, particularly from the industrial sectors, for starting international flights from Dibrugarh to Bangkok and Singapore. Mega projects like Brahmaputra Cracker and Polymer Limited, India's longest rail cum road bridge Bogibeel bridge and other upcoming modern urban infrastructure are transforming Dibrugarh into a vibrant city. Of late, the city of Dibrugarh is emerging as a popular destination for business and leisure trips for tourists from India and abroad and the 9th edition of the North East Business Summit was held in the city with the theme ""Building bridges with South East Asia"", where representatives from South East Asian nations and business leaders of the country pledged to contribute substantially for the socio-economic growth of the North East.

This video is some special kind of video because of some fantastic things. I'm not a big fan of religious Monuments even if its a Temple, Mosque, Church or Monastery, but this time it turns out very different, when I entered in this monastery, the whole environment was different, children were playing football, sitting in Gardens etc. & this made me curious about their life, so I decided to talk to them :)

Moreh is a town located on the India–Myanmar border in the Tengnoupal district of the Indian state of Manipur. Moreh is a town located in Indo-Myanmar in the Tengnoupal district of Indian State Manipur. The town is mainly inhabited by the Kuki community and a sizeable population of Meitei, Nepali, Tamil, Punjabi, Telugu, Muslim Pangal, Bihari, Marwari. Moreh plays a very important role in the Indo-Myanmar relationship and also rapidly developing as a trade point in India on the border of Myanmar. Moreh is already a huge commercial hub, and economists suggested that it could become a bustling city in the next couple of decades. The town is already seen as the commercial capital of Manipur and India's Gateway to South-East Asia.
Smuggling at Moreh has a totally cosmopolitan character. In other parts of the state, the agitation against mayanges (foreigners) continues, but at Moreh, there is perfect coexistence displayed by people from all parts of the country engaged in the common pursuit of money. Indeed, the principal operators are not Manipuris but south Indians and Bengalis whose families had crossed over from Burma during the Japanese occupation in World War II and took up smuggling after the war as the only means of remaining in touch with their original country.

In this video, I have shared my experience of visiting the Biggest temple of Bangladesh - Dhakeshwari Temple. Dhakeshwari National Temple is a Hindu temple in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It is state-owned, giving it the distinction of being Bangladesh's 'National Temple'. The name ""Dhakeshwari"" (ঢাকেশ্বরী Ðhakeshshori) means ""Goddess of Dhaka"". Since the destruction of Ramna Kali Mandir in 1971 by the Pakistan Army during the Bangladesh Liberation War, the Dhakeshwari Temple has assumed status as the most important Hindu place of worship in Bangladesh. It is also the largest Hindu temple in Bangladesh. This temple is part of the famous Shakti Peethas in Indian Subcontinent. Here the gem of sati's crown had fallen.

Hello Guys,

In this video, I have shared my experience of trains journeys in Uzbekistan. Rail transport in Uzbekistan. As of March 2017, the total length of Uzbekistan's main railway network is 4,669 km (2,446 km of which is electrified).[1] A large percentage of the system’s track requires major repair. The main line is the portion of the Transcaspian Railroad that connects Tashkent with the Amu Darya. There are rail links with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan (see Trans-Caspian Railway), Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan. Suburban traffic only exists around Tashkent.

Indians as migrant workers first began to arrive in modern-day Saudi Arabia in relatively small number from the British Raj soon after the discovery of oil in 1938,[6] but had their migration skyrocketed exponentially after the 1973 energy crisis and subsequent oil boom. However, migration to Saudi Arabia dropped dramatically after reaching its peak in 2014 due to the introduction of Nitaqat scheme in 2011, acceleration of 2010s oil glut by early 2016 and the launch of Saudi Vision 2030.

In this video, I have shared my Experience of crossing the Brahmaputra river in Bangladesh near to India ( Assam ) border.
The Brahmaputra, also known as the Yarlung Tsangpo in Tibet, the Siang/Dihang River in Arunachal Pradesh, and Luit, Dilao in Assam, is a trans-boundary river which flows through Tibet, India, and Bangladesh. It is the 9th largest river in the world by discharge, and the 15th longest. 
The Ganges Delta (also known as the Sundarbans Delta or the Bengal Delta is a river delta in the Bengal region of South Asia, consisting of Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal. It is the world's largest river delta and it empties into the Bay of Bengal with the combined waters of several river systems, mainly those of the Brahmaputra river and the Ganges river. It is also one of the most fertile regions in the world, thus earning the nickname the Green Delta. The delta stretches from the Hooghly River east as far as the Meghna River.

In this video, I have shared my experience of exploring the tribal market of Khgarachari. The Chakma people are a tribal group from the eastern-most regions of the Indian subcontinent. They are the largest ethnic group in the Chittagong Hill Tracts region of southeastern Bangladesh, and the second-largest in Mizoram, India (Chakma Autonomous District). Other places in Northeast India also have significant Chakma populations. Around 50,000 Chakmas live in Arunachal Pradesh, India; a first generation migrated there in 1964 after the Kaptai Dam tragedy. Also, 40,000-50,000 Chakmas live in Tripura, India, and 20,000-30,000 in Assam, India.

http://bit.ly/NomadicIndian

Hello Guys,
In this video, I have shared my second experience of hitchhiking in China from Beijing to Shijiazhuang 
It took me almost 10 hours to complete this journey of 250Km. Hitchhiking in China is a little bit different than in other countries. The people of China are really amazing & helpful. In the end, I couldn't nake it to the city & I had to camp on the Road. 

THE CHINA VLOG SERIES STARTS FROM HERE :)

& now enjoy the video

In this video, I have used music from Epidemic sounds & NCS.

http://bit.ly/2JoDUWb

The third video from my Arunachal Pradesh series & my whole trip in Arunachal Pradesh was just incredible, I met with the people of tribes, I stayed with them, I have eaten with them & so much more. It just not as a trip, it was a fantastic life long experience for me. In this trip, I have tried those things which I have never dreamed of.
This trip has also bought a little lousy experience, but its a part of travelling & if we are going to highlight the bad experience, then we are just insulting the efforts of amazing people, who helped us during our travelling.

The Aydar  is part of the man-made Aydar-Arnasay system of lakes, which covers 4,000 square kilometres (1,500 mi2). This has 3 brackish water lakes (the two others being Arnasay and Tuzkan), deep basins of the south-eastern Kyzyl Kum (now in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan). The lakes are expansive reservoirs of Soviet planning.

In this video, I have shared my experience of travelling on public transport in Manipur. I took a minibus ( Winger ) from Imphal to Ukhrul.
In Ukhrul, I met a Manipuri film star, Kaiku.
Ukhrul/Hunphun is a town in the state of Manipur, India. Ukhrul is the home of the Tangkhul Naga. It is the administrative headquarter of the Ukhrul district. There are also four sub-divisions in the district for administering the villages in and around it. The villages, however, are governed by the 'village heads'.

In this video, I have shared my experience of exploring the capital of Saudi Arabia. Riyadh, Saudi Arabia’s capital and main financial hub, is on a desert plateau in the country’s center. Business district landmarks include the 302m-high Kingdom Centre, with a sky bridge connecting 2 towers, and 267m-high Al Faisaliah Centre, with a glass-globe summit. In the historical Deira district, Masmak Fort marks the site of the 1902 raid that gave the Al Sauds control of Riyadh.

Saudi Arabia, officially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, is a country on the Arabian Peninsula in Western Asia. It has a land area of about 2,150,000 km², making it the third-largest country entirely in Asia, the second-largest in the Arab world, and the largest in Western Asia.

It is the home of eleven tribes, the most beautiful indigenous people of Bangladesh. In this hilly area of immense beauty, eleven ethnic groups such as Chakma, Marma, Tripura, Tanchangya, Lushai, Pankho, Bawm, Mro, Khyang, Khumi and Chak live in harmony with nature.

Hello Guys,

Pakistani fans of Sidhu moosewala
I don't know how to express this feeling, I'm visiting Pakistan, the country which use to be a part of our country, but somehow we were divided into two pieces & since then nothing is going in a right direction. We have fought three wars & still, there were no excellent results.
Recently, India & Pakistan signed a treaty on the Kartarpur Corridor. The Kartarpur Corridor is a travel free Border crossing and secure corridor, connecting the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Pakistan to Pakistan_border with India. The pass allows devotees from India to visit the gurdwara in Kartarpur, Pakistan, 4.7 kilometres (2.9 miles) from the Pakistan_border without a visa, creating a link which allows pilgrims holding Indian passports to easily visit both the Kartarpur shrine and Dera Baba Nanak on the Indian side of the border. Pakistani Sikhs are unable to use the border crossing, and cannot access the Gurdwara Dera Baba Nanak without first obtaining an Indian visa.

& now enjoy the video

In this video, I have used music from Epidemic sounds & NCS.

http://bit.ly/NomadicIndian
If you want to explore Tlabung, you can contact:- Kirabaran Chakma +917627914651

Hello Guys,

In this video, I have explored the Wild Mizoram near to Bangaladesh Border. Tlabung is situated near to Bangladesh border. The condition of life is not such a good ion these parts of region they don't even have some basic necessities like road, gas, connectivity & education. They have to travel long distance on their boats.
The Chakma people are a native group from the eastern-most regions of the Indian subcontinent, they are the largest ethnic group in the Chittagong Hill Tracts region in southeastern Bangladesh, and in Mizoram, India (Chakma Autonomous District Council), they are the second-largest ethnic group. In Tripura, India, they are the fourth largest ethnic group and having a sizable population in other parts of Northeast India, such as, 40-50 thousand Chakmas in Arunachal Pradesh, India, who migrated there in 1964 after the Kaptai dam tragedy, and 20-30 thousand Chakmas are in Assam, India. Their ethnicity is closely linked with the peoples of East Asia. However, the Chakma language is part of the Indo-Aryan language family of the Indian subcontinent. Most Chakma people are adherents of Therevada Buddhism. The Chakmas are divided into 46 clans or Gozas.

There are 5-6 types of tribal people live in this area. Chakma, Mizo, Bodo, etc. The primary market of Tlabung hosts a Bangladeshi tribal market in which people from nearby villages comes to buy & sell their product. Their primary mode of transport is boats.

Click here to support my channel:
http://bit.ly/2JoDUWb

In this video, I have shared my experience of the ""Temple of Fire.""The Baku Ateshgah (from Persian: آتشگاه‎, Atashgāh, Azerbaijani: Atəşgah), often called the ""Fire Temple of Baku"" is a castle-like religious temple in Surakhani town (in Suraxanı raion)[2], a suburb in Baku, Azerbaijan.

Based on Persian and Indian inscriptions, the temple was used as a Hindu, Sikh, and Zoroastrian place of worship. ""Atash"" (آتش) is the Persian word for fire.[3] The pentagonal complex, which has a courtyard surrounded by cells for monks and a tetrapillar-altar in the middle, was built during the 17th and 18th centuries. It was abandoned in the late 19th century, probably due to the dwindling of the Indian population in the area. The eternal natural flame went out in 1969, after nearly a century of exploitation of petroleum and gas in the area, but is now lit by gas piped from the nearby city.[4]

The Baku Ateshgah was a pilgrimage and philosophical centre of Zoroastrians from Northwestern Indian Subcontinent, who were involved in trade with the Caspian area via the famous ""Grand Trunk Road"". The four holy elements of their belief were: ate (fire), bad (air), abi (water), and he (earth). The temple ceased to be a place of worship after 1883 with the installation of petroleum plants (industry) at Surakhany. The complex was turned into a museum in 1975. The annual number of visitors to the museum is 15,000.

Hello Guys,

In this video, I have shared my experience of Chicken's Neck Corridor. It was a different kind of experience. Chicken's neck Corridor is considered as one of the biggest threat for India's security.
The Siliguri Corridor is a narrow stretch of land (about 22 kilometres (14 mi) wide) located around the city of Siliguri in West Bengal, India. The corridor is important as it connects the states of Northeast India to the rest of India through the city of Siliguri. The countries of Nepal and Bangladesh lie on each side of the corridor and the Kingdom of Bhutan lies at the northern end of the corridor. The Kingdom of Sikkim formerly lay on the northern side of the corridor, until its merging with India in 1975

CouchSurfing is a global hospitality exchange service accessible via a website and mobile app. After setting up user profiles on which other members can post reviews, members can request lodging publicly or directly from other members, ""hang out"" with other members or join/create events.

http://bit.ly/NomadicIndian

Hey Guys,
Finally, I have entered in Mongolia after the hustle of the last 2-3 days. I have entered from the Tashanta border of Mongolia - Russia.
Tsagaannuur – Tashanta: Crossing between Barnaul and the Mongolian Altai mountains at the Durbet-Daba Pass (49.605155N, 89.465113E – be aware of the 26 kilometres of no man’s land between the Mongolian and Russian border posts). Hours of operation are Mon-Sat, 9-18.

Without your own transport, you can proceed as follows: from Barnaul, take a bus to Gorno Altaysk. From there, a minibus goes to Kosh Agach (about $30), from where you need to get a taxi to Tashanta and here bargain with Mongolian drivers (usually on a Russian UAZ 4WD) waiting to cross the border to get you to Olgii (about $15-20).

You might be lucky to find someone in Kosh-Agach driving straight to Olgii. See here for transport options starting in Kazakhstan.

With your own transport: from the border to Olgii, the first part of the road is gravel, last part tarmac. Take 4 hours to cross. Payments for quarantine spray, insurance and eco tax are asked – not sure in how far any of these are real…

Russian border guards have been known to question travellers for hours. Crossing reports are welcome here.

& now enjoy the video :)

In this video, I have used music from Epidemic sounds.

In this video, I have shared my experience of visiting the longest cable car in the world. Wings of Tatev is a 5.7 km cableway between Halidzor and the Tatev monastery in Armenia. It is the longest reversible aerial tramway built in only one section and holds the record for Longest non-stop double track cable car.[2] Construction was finished on 16 October 2010.

Wings of Tatev aerial tramway is located in the Syunik region, 250 km to the south of Yerevan.

Total ride time from Halidzor station to Tatev monastery is about 12 minutes; a much shorter trip than the 40-minute ride along the steep serpentine road that follows the Vorotan gorge. Flying over the gorge, the aerial tramway cabin reaches its maximum height of 320 meters. When the first cabin reaches the Tatev station, the second one arrives at the Halidzor station. After the Wings are reloaded, the movement starts again in the opposite direction. Each cabin accommodates 30 passengers and one steward. The ropeway can accommodate about 240 passengers per hour. Powerful pillars divide the ropeway into four sections. The longest section is 2.7 km and overlooks the Tatev monastic complex.

Click here to support my channel:
http://bit.ly/2JoDUWb

In this video, I have shared my experience of the capital city of Azerbaijan "" Baku "". Baku is entirely different from the rest of Azerbaijan, the rest of Azerbaijan looks closer to Asia and Baku looks closer to Europe.
Baku, also known as Baky or Bakı, is the largest city in the Caucasus and the capital of Azerbaijan. Baku is on the coast of the Caspian Sea on the southern tip of the Absheron Peninsula. There are three major divisions in Baku: İçəri Şəhər (the ancient city), the Soviet-built downtown, and the newest part of the town. The population as of January 2012 was 3,202,300.

Things to do in Baku, Azerbaijan

Atashgah Fire Temple. You can take the Baku Electric train from the Baku train station to Suraxani station for 10 qapiks. (No train service any longer.) Simply walk through the station to the outdoor platforms where a schedule is posted. You can also take Marshrutka 191 from Qara Qarayev metro station or bus number 184 from Azizbeyov metro station. You can pay on board or buy a ticket from a kiosk on the platform. From Suraxani station walk about 100 m (330 ft), and you can arrive at the temple. Children 0.20AZN, student 0.40AZN, adult 2AZN. If you want to take pictures, it costs 2AZN in addition to admission.
Yanar Dagh, (Take bus 217 from Koroglu metro station. The last stop is Yanar Dagh(March 2014)). Yanar Dagh is a mountain that has been continuously on fire for one thousand years. The natural gas vents ensure that hot flames roar out of the sides of this hill even when it rains. 2AZN.
Qala, (Take bus 101 or 150 from Koroglu metro station. Leave the bus when you see a new build fortress tower(~30Min) Walk down the street for 1km(April 2014)). Qala has an open-air Archeological and Ethnographic Museum. You can also find some camels, sheep and rabbits in the Museum. Next to it is a new build fortress from which you have a beautiful view of the city. 6AZN.
Artem Island, (Take bus 150 from Koroglu metro station. Goes directly to Artem Island (April 2014)). Artem Island was the first place for oil exploration in Azerbaijan. The island is not the most beautiful but worth a day trip. Hike up the lighthouse and walk over to the island and enjoy the southern tip first before you go off wandering around Artem city. In the side streets, you can find several tea houses, shops and other places.

In this video, I have shared my experience of traveling to Africa for the first time. I was waiting for this moment from a long time & finally I made it.
Rwanda, officially the Republic of Rwanda, is a landlocked country in the Great Rift Valley of Central Africa, where the African Great Lakes region and Southeast Africa converge. Located a few degrees south of the Equator, Rwanda is bordered by Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

In this video, I have shared my experience of exploring the amazing city of Petra, Jordan.
Petra, originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu or Raqēmō, is a historic and archaeological city in southern Jordan. It is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a basin surrounded by mountains forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. The area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC, and the Nabataeans might have settled in what would become the capital city of their kingdom, as early as the 4th century BC. Archaeological work has only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence dating back to the second century BC, by which time Petra had become their capital. The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's proximity to the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub.

According to the Sri Lankan folklore, Yahangala is the place where the great king Ravana is sleeping until he wakes up again. The god “Galē Bandāra” is also believed to be protecting this place. This is a place travelers have to come with good intention, because there were enough incidents that the environment or some spiritual powers has been punished travelers who came with bad intension.

The people who leaves here are faces a lots of problems coz of the negligence of the Government. Traveling in NorthEast India is totally a different kind of experience ❤️🤗

It is also the former capital of Iran, during the Zand dynasty's era (1747-79), and also the celebrated birthplace of the great Persian poets Hafiz and Saadi.

Hello Guys,

In this video, I have shared my expense of traveling India from Thailand. Thailand is a Southeast Asian country. It's known for tropical beaches, opulent royal palaces, ancient ruins and ornate temples displaying figures of Buddha. In Bangkok, the capital, an ultramodern cityscape rises next to quiet canalside communities and the iconic temples of Wat Arun, Wat Pho and the Emerald Buddha Temple (Wat Phra Kaew). Nearby beach resorts include bustling Pattaya and fashionable Hua Hin

Gurpaal Paaji's Channel:- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSklZCssqrKL-qmuaWEVXAg

Hello Guys,
I don't know how to express this feeling, I'm visiting Pakistan, the country which use to be a part of our country, but somehow we were divided into two pieces & since then nothing is going in a right direction. We have fought three wars & still, there were no excellent results.
Recently, India & Pakistan signed a treaty on the Kartarpur Corridor. The Kartarpur Corridor is a @sa_(travel)-free @rder_crossing and secure corridor, connecting the @rdwara_Darbar_Sahib_Kartarpur in Pakistan to @dia%E2%80%93Pakistan_border with India. The pass allows @kh devotees from India to visit the gurdwara in @rtarpur,_Pakistan, 4.7 kilometres (2.9 miles) from the @dia%E2%80%93Pakistan_border without a visa, creating a link which allows pilgrims holding Indian passports to easily visit both the Kartarpur shrine and @ra_Baba_Nanak on the Indian side of the border. @kistani_Sikhs are unable to use the border crossing, and cannot access the Gurdwara Dera Baba Nanak without first obtaining an Indian visa.

& now enjoy the video

Koh Phi Phi or Phi Phi Islands are located in the middle of the Andaman sea, 42 km away from Amphoe Mueang. It is a part of Nopharat Thara Beach – Phi Phi Islands national park which contains 2 big islands – Koh Phi Phi Don and Koh Phi Phi Le, and 4 smaller islands nearby – Koh Yung, Koh Mai Phai, Koh Pida Nok and Koh Pida Nai.

Koh Phi Phi also features a vibrant NIGHTLIFE, with Tonsai Beach containing dozens of beach bars and restaurants and lively Tonsai Village consisting of a maze of shops, bars, and restaurants. Smaller beaches around the island are alternatively ideal for honeymooners, families, those on a budget, and those looking for the ultimate luxury resort retreat.

Phi Phi Le was featured in the Hollywood blockbuster movie The Beach, a story about the ultimate secluded island beach. Maya Bay was a suitable choice as it epitomizes the stunning beauty of these islands: a bay of pellucid aquamarine water surrounded by towering limestone cliffs that harbours an arcing, white sand beach.

In this video, I have shared my experience of Russian Hospitality which I have received from Chechnyan people. We are were hitchhiking from Grozny to Vladikavkaz & then we got picked by a local resident of Chechnya. First, he took us into the forest to show some sights and then he invited us for lunch with his family. A lot of people warned me about this area, they told me it's not right,  there are lots of tension in these regions, but the thing I have experienced, these are the most amazing people in Whole Russia. Their hospitality is amazing and they really are fun loving people :)

Chittagong Ship Breaking Yard is located in Faujdarhat, Sitakunda Upazila, Bangladesh along the 18 kilometres (11 mi) Sitakunda coastal strip, 20 kilometres (12 mi) north-west of Chittagong. Handling about a fifth of the world's total, it was the world's largest ship breaking yard, until that record was taken by Alang in India. It employs over 200,000 Bangladeshis, and accounts for around one-half of all the steel in Bangladesh

Hey Guys,
In this video, I have shared my experience of exploring Loktak Lake.
Loktak Lake is the largest freshwater lake in North East India and is famous for the phumdis (heterogeneous mass of vegetation, soil and organic matter at various stages of decomposition) floating over it. The lake is located at Moirang in Manipur state, India.[2] The etymology of Loktak is Lok = ""stream"" and tak = ""the end"". The largest of all the phumdis covers an area of 40 km2 (15 sq mi) and is situated on the southeastern shore of the lake. Located on this phumdi, Keibul Lamjao National Park is the only floating national park in the world. The park is the last natural refuge of the endangered Sangai (state animal), Rucervus eldii eldii or Manipur brown-antlered deer (Cervus eldi eldi), one of three subspecies of Eld's deer.

Hello Guys,
In this video, I have shared my experience of Deepest Metro Station in the world. Arsenalna is a station on Kyiv Metro’s Sviatoshynsko-Brovarska Line. The station was opened along with the first stage and is currently the deepest station in the world at 105.5 metres. This is attributed to Kyiv’s geography where the high bank of the Dnieper River rises above the rest of the city.

In this video, I have shared my experience of Camping in the desert of Al Ula, Saudi Arabia. Al-'Ula, is a city of the Medina Region in north-western Saudi Arabia. Historically located on the incense route, the city lies within the Governorate of 'Ula , one of seven in the Medina Region. The walled city of Al-'Ula was founded in the 6th century BC, an oasis in the desert valley, with fertile soil and plenty of water. It was located along ""Incense Road"", the network of routes that facilitated the trading of spices, silk and other luxury items through Arabia, Egypt and India. Al-'Ula stands on the site of the Biblical city of Dedan but was founded with the ancient North Arabian Kingdom of Lihyan, which ruled from the 5th to 2nd century BC. The older history of the oasis has been divided into several phases. The Dedanite kingdom spans the seventh and sixth centuries BC. Dedan is mentioned in the 'Harran Inscriptions'. In these it is told how Nabonidus the king of Babylonia made a military campaign to northern Arabia in 552 BC or somewhat later, conquering Tayma Dedan and Yathrib (Medina).  It is thought that around the turn of the fifth century BC the kingdom became hereditary.",344161,16670,914

The people who leaves here are faces a lots of problems coz of the negligence of the Government. Traveling in NorthEast India is totally a different kind of experience ❤️🤗
Dong village in Arunachal Pradesh, which is known as the easternmost village in India, witness the earliest sunrise in the country. At about 1,240 metres above sea-level, Dong is located between China and Myanmar. On an average, the sun rises at around 5:00 AM and sets at around 5:00 PM in Dong.

Kaho is a small village on the banks of Lohit River at an elevation of 1,240 meters (4,070 ft) on the India-China LAC in Anjaw district of Arunachal Pradesh state in India. It is 580 km east of Itanagar, nearly 70 km north of district headquarter at Hawai, nearly 8 km south of India-China LAC, 30 km west of Diphu Pass near India-China-Myanmar tri-junction, and 10 km north of Kibithu. Nearest air connectivity is 30 km in the south at Walong airstrip in Walong. The village has an Indian Army check-post. Kaho will be projected as the first village of the country by team Discover FarEast with the help of district administration.
 I also visited the Hot Spring  along the Lohit river, in a low lying area , is located a small hot spring which during winter remains surrounded by warm sand dunes and in summer by slim streamlets carrying the warm waters of the hot spring to the beautiful Lohit river.

Ukraine has become one of the most preferable destinations for aspiring students who want to study MBBS in abroad. Some of the advantages are listed below:

1. The medical universities of Ukraine are recognised by WHO, UNESCO, MCI and medical councils of many other counties.

2. The medium of instruction in Ukraine is English which makes it much easier for international students to adapt to the environment.

Dhargyeling Tibetan Settlement Tezu was established in the year 1962. It was earlier situated in the Lohit District of (NEFA) and now falls in Arunachal Pradesh State which is fairly close to the Indo-Burmese (Myanmar) border. It is about 6 Km from the town of Tezu and its altitude of 450 feet above the sea level. The temperature during the summer months averages about 108 degrees Fahrenheit and coldest 3-degree centigrade during wintertime. The most difficult part is in summer because of high humidity and sometimes it is difficult to breathe as well. The average rainfall in a year is approximately 133 inches. There is a river called Tindolong (Lama River) which runs annually from camp 5 to 1 and meets the Brahmaputra river , which is of two miles flowing distance from the settlement. The local inhabitants of the area are mainly Mizos, Mishmi and Digaru Mishmi. But today one will find a very diverse community in the area due to migration of all kinds of people in the region.
In this video, I have shared my experience of Hitchhiking on the dangerous roads of Arunachal Pradesh. The condition of roads in Arunachal Pradesh is really bad & Currently I'm hitchhiking on the border roads which connects the rest of India to the Chinese Border. The people who leaves here are faces a lots of problems coz of the negligence of the Government. Traveling in NorthEast India is totally a different kind of experience ❤️🤗

In this video, I have shared my experience of traveling to the Catalina Seaplane Wreckage . Abandoned between the Red Sea and the desert of Saudi Arabia for nearly 50 years, Catalina Seaplane Wreckage is truly a sight to behold. Visitors can get a closer look at the 1930s American military seaplane that has laid near the Ras Al-Sheikh Hameed a few hours away from the city. 

Tabuk is home to some of Saudi Arabia's most famous natural and historical jewels such as ‘Jibal Hisma’ the majestic sandstone formations that originated from Jordan’s Wadi Rum. The city is also a popular destination for travellers looking for a gateway to the Tabuk region, which is packed with untouched islands, splendid coral reefs and pristine white beaches that guarantee a fun holiday filled with thrilling activities such as diving and swimming.",334811,15687,618

In this video, I have shared my experience of Hitchhiking on the dangerous roads of Arunachal Pradesh. The condition of roads in Arunachal Pradesh is really bad & Currently I'm hitchhiking on the border roads which connects the rest of India to the Chinese Border. The people who leaves here are faces a lots of problems coz of the negligence of the Government. Traveling in NorthEast India is totally a different kind of experience ❤️🤗
Dong village in Arunachal Pradesh, which is known as the easternmost village in India, witness the earliest sunrise in the country. At about 1,240 metres above sea-level, Dong is located between China and Myanmar. On an average, the sun rises at around 5:00 AM and sets at around 5:00 PM in Dong.

Kaho is a small village on the banks of Lohit River at an elevation of 1,240 meters (4,070 ft) on the India-China LAC in Anjaw district of Arunachal Pradesh state in India. It is 580 km east of Itanagar, nearly 70 km north of district headquarter at Hawai, nearly 8 km south of India-China LAC, 30 km west of Diphu Pass near India-China-Myanmar tri-junction, and 10 km north of Kibithu. Nearest air connectivity is 30 km in the south at Walong airstrip in Walong. The village has an Indian Army check-post. Kaho will be projected as the first village of the country by team Discover FarEast with the help of district administration.
 I also visited the Hot Spring  along the Lohit river, in a low lying area , is located a small hot spring which during winter remains surrounded by warm sand dunes and in summer by slim streamlets carrying the warm waters of the hot spring to the beautiful Lohit river.

Geological evidence suggests that this bridge is a former land connection between India and Sri Lanka.[2]

The feature is 48 km (30 mi) long and separates the Gulf of Mannar (southwest) from the Palk Strait (northeast). Some of the regions are dry, and the sea in the area rarely exceeds 1 metre (3 ft) in depth, thus hindering navigation. It was reportedly passable on foot until the 15th century when storms deepened the channel. Ramanathaswamy Temple records say that Ram Setu was entirely above sea level until it broke in a cyclone in 1480.

According to legends, Ram setu Bridge was constructed by Lord Ram when he went to Sri Lanka to save Sita mata from Sri Lankan king Raavan. In Sri Lanka people also call this bridge as Hanuman Bridge. This is also mentioned in Ramayan.

192,UCgilhqoyZrXV2EBlaaAtVaw,HyYDE1IqGQM,2019-09-16T04:09:19Z,MY FIRST DAY IN MONGOLIA - Indian in Mongolia 🇲🇳,"SUBSCRIBE to our channel:
http://bit.ly/NomadicIndian

Hey Guys,
Finally, I have entered in Mongolia after the hustle of the last 2-3 days. I have entered from the Tashanta border of Mongolia - Russia.
Tsagaannuur – Tashanta: Crossing between Barnaul and the Mongolian Altai mountains at the Durbet-Daba Pass (49.605155N, 89.465113E – be aware of the 26 kilometres of no man’s land between the Mongolian and Russian border posts). Hours of operation are Mon-Sat, 9-18.

Without your own transport, you can proceed as follows: from Barnaul, take a bus to Gorno Altaysk. From there, a minibus goes to Kosh Agach (about $30), from where you need to get a taxi to Tashanta and here bargain with Mongolian drivers (usually on a Russian UAZ 4WD) waiting to cross the border to get you to Olgii (about $15-20).

You might be lucky to find someone in Kosh-Agach driving straight to Olgii. See here for transport options starting in Kazakhstan.

With your own transport: from the border to Olgii, the first part of the road is gravel, last part tarmac. Take 4 hours to cross. Payments for quarantine spray, insurance and eco tax are asked – not sure in how far any of these are real…

Russian border guards have been known to question travellers for hours. Crossing reports are welcome here.

& now enjoy the video :)

In this video, I have used music from Epidemic sounds.

Dhaka is the capital city of Bangladesh, in southern Asia. Set beside the Buriganga River, it’s at the center of national government, trade and culture. The 17th-century old city was the Mughal capital of Bengal, and many palaces and mosques remain. American architect Louis Khan’s National Parliament House complex typifies the huge, fast-growing modern metropolis.

http://bit.ly/NomadicIndian

Hello Guys,

In this video, I hitchhiked from Tlabung to Chawngte. After spending 2-3 days in Tlabung, I decided to move towards the Burmese border. Initially, my plan was to travel in Tata Sumo, but I couldn't find. After this, I decided to hitchhike. Tlabung is situated near to the Bangladesh border & this was my first time when I hitchhiked in border areas.

In this video, I have used music from Epidemic sound

Hello Guys,

In this video, I have shared my experience with Iran. In the beginning, it was a scary decision to travel in Iran due to all those media reports but somehow I decided to travel to Iran & that decision has changed my life.
The International banking system doesn't work in Iran. I didn't know about this fact. I faced a lot of problems due to this, but Irani people helped me a lot.
