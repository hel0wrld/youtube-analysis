In this series  we are going to cover 5 main destinations by road - Wayanad, Athirapally falls, Vagamon, Varkala, and Alleppey. In this episode, I'm in Varkala, with some of the best beaches! It has places like black sand beach, and North Cliff, restaurants like Inda Cafe and Kerala God's Own Country Kitchen. 

I actually traveled to Kerala from Karnataka and took an RT-PCR negative report with me while travelling and in this episode, I stayed at Cliff Stories, which is a really nice place for relaxing and staying at. üòÄ

And I'm seriously looking to work on my fitness these days. I like to keep my workouts fun and engaging, so picking up a new activity always helps. I usually do this while travelling as well. I mix up my days with a lot of walking, fun activities and staying active. 

The best part is that I am also texting out the Mahindra XUV 300 while I'm here, and driving around long distances around Delhi is always a pleasure. Plus the driving experience itself is amazing. Watch the whole video to find out how I made the most of this opportunity while also enjoying activities like Parkour, Aerial Yoga, and Wall Climbing.

When I was in Bangkok, I really wanted to check this place out for myself! For an entry fee of 350 Baht, you get to play with these adorable dogs for 1 hour!! The place is called True love cafe. But speaking objectively, here are some things you must know. 

What I liked about the place: 
‚ú® The dogs are very very well kept and happy, with a full-time staff dedicated to their needs. They get to eat well, play, run around etc. 
‚ú® The owner treats each one of them like her kids and so they are very well loved. 
‚ú® Each dog has a distinct personality with names that suit them and you can actually get to know them. 
‚ú® Every dog was bred at the facility over the course of 11 years or so, without exploitation. 

What I mildly disliked: 
‚ú® The dogs seemed to be trained for photos, which is both adorable and slightly questionable of us humans. Anyhow, I spent a good evening with these cuties and had a lot of fun getting to know them as well. 
‚ú® I visited this place at a time when it was empty, but it is known to be a tourist hot spot with long lines that extend to the parking lot, for visitors who want to see the dogs. So visit at your own discretion. üòÑ

Also, not me getting influenced by my boyfriend to visit the True love cafe! ü§™ Thanks to the amazing, handsome, humble, down-to-earth, best person ever Eshan (Totally not narrated by him, himself)

The Himba Tribe is one of the most prominent and fascinating tribes of Namibia, known the world over for preserving their unique cultural identity and age-old traditions for living in a low-water ecosystem. During my road trip across Namibia, I took a little detour to go meet the Himba Tribals in an attempt to understand their lifestyle a little better. This is my way of documenting the experience for the purpose of education about a different culture. 

WARNING: The Himba ladies are known culturally to have bare exposed chests as part of their attire. While I didn't wish to shock or disrespect my viewers, I do hope they view this video entirely from the perspective of education about a different kind of lifestyle. The dressing sense of the Himba women is in no way a sexual depiction of nudity as it is pretty culturally accepted in their vicinity. Hence I chose to leave the video as it is without blurring any bits. As part of my creator responsibility, I have demonetized this video.

I went straight to Paro as first part of my road trip in the country. The drive from Phuntsholing took about 4 hours. 
 
The entire budget of my Bhutan trip was close to  INR 25k. You can carry cash everywhere in Indian currency in Bhutan as it is accepted. Some things about Paro below:

1. The place where I stayed at in Paro is called Ama‚Äôs Village Lodge. You can book the place here - https://www.booking.com/s/32_8/e9f2a7ab

2.  The cost of entry to Taktsang Goempa is INR 500 and a round trip with any driver will cost INR 1000 from your lodge

3. You can contact Mr. Yonten Norbu for driving you around Bhutan if you are visiting. His number is +975 17672515 , my experience with him was extremely nice. He was a perfect gentleman who ensured my safety and also made sure my experience in Bhutan was memorable.
 
4. If you are visiting Bhutan, I would highly advice you to get a local sim for contacting tour agencies or driver. A local sim will be available for INR 200 at Phuntsholing. 

5. Other places that you can visit in Paro are - Paro Dzong and you can get a Hot Stone bath which is very popular in the area

But one thing that people don't know about is that visiting Gulmarg, Kashmir is even possible over a slightly longer weekend if you have a Friday off. And it is a very accessible place if you take a flight to Srinagar. One of the highlights of the place is that it is a very developed winter destination for pursuing sports like Skiing and Snowboarding. 

Having said that, I feel like Kashmir is also a very safe place for tourism and one must visit without any doubts that you will have a wonderful experience because of the warm and welcoming locals.

‚òëÔ∏è Thailand: Has a 1 day quarantine that ends after you test negative, you can opt for a visa on arrival or e-visa and it‚Äôs a pretty solo travel friendly destination! 

‚òëÔ∏è Sri Lanka: You don‚Äôt need to quarantine if you are fully vaccinated. You don‚Äôt need to present a negative report either in such cases. The visa process is entirely online or can plan it as a solo workation destination as well! 

‚òëÔ∏è Turkey: You need a negative report within 72 hours of travelling. The visa process is online and can be applied for easily. The cost of Turkish e-visa is $48. 

‚òëÔ∏è Cambodia: Similar travel requirements as Sri Lanka and Turkey with regards to the quarantine period. The visa is usually processed upon arrival or can be obtained online.  The tourist visa is valid for 1 month and it‚Äôs costs $20

‚òëÔ∏è Indonesia: Bali is an island in Indonesia which was my first ever solo destination! No visa is required for Indian tourists if you‚Äôre visiting for lesser than 30 days. The quarantine period has been slashed to 1 day if you‚Äôre a fully vaccinated traveller, as opposed to 7 days earlier! But that is only true if you‚Äôre landing in Bali.

Hope this post helps you in travelling abroad, in the coming months! I had shot this video originally for YT shorts, but if you do like it, follow me here and save this video. üòä

It is a beautiful place unlike any that I've ever seen before. But much like any beautiful tourist destination, there's a growing burden of plastic and trash that plagues the place. Burning of trash is a regular local practice currently in many of our Indian cities and towns because of a lack of trash disposal system. Wouldn't it be better if we stopped creating trash, to begin with? This Episode aims to bring to light the plastic problem in India. 

In some good News though, Dzukou Valley is now declared a plastic-free zone

These passports were made in 1976 and ‚Äò81 respectively and I find them so fascinating!

Context - my nana ji (grandfather) was an engineer when he was younger and passed out of Roorkee University (present day IIT Roorkee) in the branch of mechanical engineering. In one of his trainings, he was sent to Austria in 1964 for almost a year. Then he got a job in different countries and was able to travel extensively with his entire family. Yup, even my mom.

Can you imagine how ancient these passports are! üò±

On my recent trip to my grandparents place, I had the opportunity to see all their passports from over the years and then the idea of this series was born. In the next part, I‚Äôll show you 1970s and 1980s ka passport! I felt like the 1960s really just deserved a video of its own. This is 3 part series. ü§™

Do you experience random stigma around online dating? It is often seen as taboo to be spoken about,  but I‚Äôve really wanted to give it a shot for a while now, because why not? In most cases it could turn into a fun activity, a reason to go out and a chance to find a meaningful relationship. So I accepted the challenge to try it for myself and decided to download Bumble since a lot of my friends often tell me how much they like it. In this video, I'm going out on not just one, not just two, but three dates I met from Bumble! P.S. I also reached out to the guys who you see in the video and planned all the dates entirely. Of course, took permission from them as well to have them on video. :D

My verdict: Ladies, the guys out there are really not bad! Don't hesitate to make the first move, and plan fun dates. And guys, hope you enjoyed watching a girl's take on online dating :D So don't shy away from looking for meaningful relationships online :)

The advantage of flying via UAE is that you can also get a transit visa for 48 hours for just ‚Çπ1999. It‚Äôs an e-visa which you can apply for before your trip starts.

P.S. the final flight cost as per this reel is ‚Çπ31,000 and along with visa it‚Äôs ‚Çπ33,000 and I‚Äôve used this route as an example that you can find good flight deals by breaking up the trip as opposed to flying all the way from India.

As a bonus, you can also spend time in Abu Dhabi if you like or depart straight away from the airport keeping enough time in between for immigration and self transfer.

BUT, you may not get additional baggage in this route, so check and book once you look into all details

Do you like this idea? You may use it to start planning a trip for the summer already!",639552,32467,302

In this video, we try the traditional Naga Food for the first time right from restaurant cooked food to home-brewed rice beer to cooking on an open fire! This is the most comprehensive food guide that you may come across for the regions that are explored in the video. 

Accompanying me on this journey is Larissa Dsa (Instagram: @Larissa_wlc), who has an impeccable style and spirit of adventure, and hence we will together discover the fashion and food secrets of Nagaland. Besides a perfect co-traveller, she is also a brilliant YouTuber and Photographer herself. You absolutely can't miss her work! :)

A second perfect addition to this trip is Namrata Menon, a very talented videographer/cinematographer. She and her work for me were an instant love and I can't recommend her enough for more video projects. Not only is she a talented girl, but also super fun to travel with. 

Our trio survived a 15 day worth of madness and exciting travel adventure and I cannot wait to share the whole series with you. This and is very different from my other travel series thus far. Stay tuned and hope this Trailer excites you!

In this episode I started from Delhi Airport, landed at Leh and stayed at Stok for 2 days to rest. When flying to a higher altitude, it is always recommended that you rest for at least 1 day to acclimatize, and also carry a body oxygen saturation meter with you. It is also advised that you hydrate really well with atleast 2L of water everyday and start a course of diamox before travelling (Please consult a doctor for dosage requirements)

I went to Thimphu after Paro, as first part of my road trip in the country. The drive from Paro to Thimphu took about 2 hours. I also did an epic bike tour in the city and enjoyed it thoroughly 
 
The entire budget of my Bhutan trip was close to  INR 25-30k. You can carry cash everywhere in Indian currency in Bhutan as it is accepted. Some things about Paro below:

1. The place where I stayed at in Thimphu is called Bhutan Boutique Residency. You can book the place here - http://www.booking.com/Share-BbKCu9

2.  The cost of renting a cycle in Bhutan from Wheels for Hills Bicycle outlet is INR 2000 for a day. The shop is located in Olakha and the location is not specified in Google Maps in my experience. So you can contact them through this website - http://www.bhutanmountainbike.com/ to ask for the correct address. Although a little pricy, I would highly recommed renting a cycle through them since my experience of the same was really nice. The cycle was also of good quality

3. Ms. Yanchen has a tour agency in Bhutan called Bhutan Mountain Bike Adventure - http://www.bhutanmountainbike.com/
They organise Bike tours to various parts of the country. Also to some very unknown places that even I am not covering in my vlogs. They will do all documentation for you too. Their services are top notch. As a friend of theirs, I would obviously say good things, but trust me, you won't regret if you book through them, if you want to experience something different. 
 
4. Like I mentioned in my previous video, if you need a driver in Bhutan, you may contact Mr. Yonten. His number is +975 17672515 , my experience with him was extremely nice. He was a perfect gentleman who that my experience in Bhutan was memorable. Also, he speaks in Hindi if you prefer that. When you contact him, please speak in Hindi only. 
 
4. If you are visiting Bhutan, I would highly advice you to get a local sim for contacting tour agencies or driver. A local sim will be available for INR 200 at Phuntsholing.

BUDGET Vs LUXURY in Maldives?? When I first thought of traveling to the Maldives, I knew my ideal trip would be a comparison between visiting a local island vs also going to a resort island. And let me tell you, that I was extremely happy about this decision. The local island provides a perfect insight into what locals really live like. You get to experience a smaller more localized experience and you can enjoy excursions/activities without breaking your wallet! The luxury island, on the other hand, is the most relaxing holiday you could wish for. With 10/10 hospitality, pool sides, beaches, and villas will make you feel pampered and a little spoilt as well! This was one of my favorite destinations ever, and I'll easily count it in my top 3 for now!

Additionally, my stay in Fulidhoo was arranged by the Fulidhoo dive centre.

My trip to the unknown Arunachal Pradesh from November 3 to November 14, 2018 was organised by ChaloHoppo, a travel company in Northeast India. If you are planning a trip to NE India too, I would recommend that you exercise personal discretion and go through all ratings and reviews once personally as well. Cheers!  :)",365194,16738,1710

This video is made in collaboration with Airtel. I was invited to their event to experience lightning-fast internet speeds thanks to Airtel 5G (on a trial network) which are upwards of 1Gbps download speeds.  I also got to meet and interact with the top content creators of India, which was truly quite exciting. The cherry on the cake was when Kapil Dev himself came to the event. There were many top sports athletes present as well. Big thanks to Airtel and the entire team for this experience. The future looks very promising with Airtel 5G

I can‚Äôt even begin to explain how underrated this tip is. Pick-pocketing is one of the most common travel safety hazards around the world and can impact ANYONE. If you lose your passport in another country or your wallet while travelling locally. Or worse, what if somebody steals your phone with years of memories stored on it? 

TRUST ME, Get yourself a fanny pack and carry it everywhere with you when you‚Äôre on the move. This is why you‚Äôll always find me with my bag in 90% of my content. That‚Äôs the only reason why this bag is my favourite and I never need to buy expensive designer bags. ü§™ But jokes aside, save this and share the tip with your travel buddies. Someday this will save your trip and prevent theft. ‚ùå‚ùå

P.S. For everybody who keeps asking me about my bag, I love it because it‚Äôs stylish but also of great utility. I picked it from a VS store at an airport one time and never moved away from it. Haha! If you find something similar, just buy it. It only cost me ‚Çπ3500 or so and has lasted me for 3 years already.",354998,13683,142

I went to Punakha after thimphu, as first part of my road trip in the country. This video is in collaboration with Zinigo

Zinigo organises trips to Bhutan, Sikkim, Meghalaya, to some really off beat locations. They also have special packages for North East India in case you're planning a trip anywhere. With me they came up with a special discount code for all of you: TANYA@BHUTAN . Those who book through this would get flat INR 2000 off on all their package cost. To use the coupon code, send a mail to sandip.tiwari@zinigo.com
Hope this helps you plan your trip.
 
The entire budget of my Bhutan trip was close to  INR 25-30k. You can carry cash everywhere in Indian currency in Bhutan as it is accepted. Some things about Paro below:

 
** If you need a driver in Bhutan, you may contact Mr. Yonten. His number is +975 17672515. You can also reach out to Mr. Somraj Chettri: +975 77451302. 
 
** If you are visiting Bhutan, I would highly advice you to get a local sim for contacting tour agencies or driver. A local sim will be available for INR 200 at Phuntsholing. 

** I stayed in Punakha at Damchen Resort

I'm visiting Bhutan solo by road, and this is the first video in the series. The nearest airport is Bagdogra airport although you can also fly Druk Airways and land directly at Paro (expensive option). From Bagdogra it takes about 5 hours to reach Phuntsholing by road and you can get a taxi from right outside the airport. At Phuntsholing border you will require a permit to visit beyond the 5 km border radius. The visa entry is otherwise free, but the permit is issued for 7 days based on some background checks and upon submission of the following documents - 

1) Photocopy of your identity card - Passport/Voter's ID card
2) An immigration form that is provided at any shop near Immigration office
3) Proof of stay of onward journey (You will need confirmed proof of booking for atleast first night in Thimphu/Paro)
4) One passport size photograph
5) For all solo female travellers - Please write a hand written undertaking stating that you are responsible for your own safety and address it to The Immigration Officer, Immigration office, Phuntsholing Bhutan,

For getting a permit at the earliest, please reach the office at 8:30 am with all your documents and stand in a queue. The office opens at 9:00 am. In my case I got the permit within half hour because I arrived early. 

For booking the same hotel that I stayed in, you can use the following link - https://www.booking.com/s/32_8/e9f2a7ab
You'll earn INR 700 on your booking once you book and stay at the hotel.

During my recent visit to Bali, I visited Nusa Penida and stayed there. It is one of the most beautiful places you will ever visit. I also went Scuba diving with Nusa Penida Water Sports and dived with Manta Rays at Manta Bay. That by far I feel is the best of my Bali experience, until I top it with something else next time. Hope you enjoy this video. :)

If you're wondering of the cost to reach here, the speed boat that I took charges IDR (local currency of Indonesia) 400,000 for round trip.
The round trip ticket is an open ticket. You can return on any day if you purchase one. 

The expense of 2 dives in Nusa Pendia that I did towards the end of the video costed me approx. IDR 1,100,000

Sossusvlei & Deadvlei | Ghost Town Namibia | Finale Vlog,"This is the finale vlog from the NAMIBIA SERIES where I drove around for almost 2000 KM through the entire country! In this particular vlog, I visited Namib Naukluft Park where you have to pay an entry permit of around N$ 70
Inside Namib Naukluft Park I visited Dune 45 and Deadvlei. In both places, I did a little hike which is honestly tougher than it looks. My favourite part of the video though is the fact that I got to recreate a little bit of Bollywood in Dealvlei where the song Guzarish was originally shot. 

The music for the cover song in this video is provided by Akash Maheshwari

Not only does it appear as if it is floating on the lake, but that also adds to the charm and mysticism of the place. Because I was headed for a stay at this property, I figured that this is also a great opportunity to collaborate with the Tiwari sisters because Udaipur is their favorite city.

I arrived in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, also formerly known as Saigon, only to realise that English is not as common, even in such a big and vibrant city. But in Rome, do as Romans, so I took the help of Google maps, translate and lens to find interesting things about my destinations. 

Did you know that you can also download the Vietnamese language offline so that it is easy to communicate even when you are not connected to the internet? 

The places that I visited within the city were:

Comprehensive travel guide from my solo trip to Thailand | Tanya Khanijow,"During my stay in Bangkok, I wanted to try some of the excellent food, and grand malls, visit Wat Arun, and Wat Pho, and primarily go for a cycling trip to the green lungs of the city - Bang Krachao. Overall, I had a fantastic time in Bangkok and I think I'd be eager to visit again sometime. Perhaps for some actual shopping in its malls next time? What's on your Thailand bucket list? Did you think any of the places that I've mentioned in this vlog will make it to the cut?

Once upon a time while travelling I met with a small accident that gave me some wounds and those got infected from entering into seawater. I had no idea of what medicines I should take especially because I didn‚Äôt have a doctor around me. I called a doctor friend and asked for medical advice. She helped me figure out what medicines I could buy from a local pharmacy in Indonesia after multiple rounds of translations. Emergencies can happen at any time and it‚Äôs always better to be prepared. Especially if you like to travel and adventure! Hope this video inspires you to create your own medicine bag üòâ

ALSO! Big shout out to Eshan who literally heard my travel tales and one day & decided to buy this bag for me and he only added all the medicines, to begin with. ü§™

But what is the experience of travelling to such a vibrant city and not trying your hands at shopping, no? So I went shopping with Kritika Khurana a.k.a @thatbohogirl and experienced shops like Topshop, Bershka, Urban Outfitters and Primark. None of which I had shopped at before. I found all these stores at Oxford Street. Our Airbnb was also quite conveniently located near Tuffnell Park Tube station and Camden town. 

In this video, I'm collaborating with a really cool brand. Noise cancellation works great on the PlayGo BH70 headset from this new brand called PLAY. So, these headphones will be launching very soon at a price of Rs. 14,999/- Please check out more details on the link below:
https://www.worldofplay.in/playgo/bh70/

I have been using these headsets and I must say that I have had a great experience! We got to experience it much before the launch though, it will be available soon. Check out the video to know of all the nice features! :)

Here's an ode to the beautiful state of Nagaland as we discover a little something about the culture, the tribes, the upcoming fashion designers, the pop culture and the FOOD (very important) of the North East Indian state of Nagaland! 

Accompanying me on this journey is Larissa Dsa, who has an impeccable style and spirit of adventure, and hence we will together discover the fashion and food secrets of Nagaland. Besides a perfect co-traveller, she is also a brilliant YouTuber and Photographer herself. You absolutely can't miss her work! :)

A second perfect addition to this trip is Namrata Menon, a very talented videographer/cinematographer. She and her work for me were and instant love and I can't recommend her enough for more video projects. Not only is she a talented girl, but also super fun to travel with. 

Our trio survived a 15 day worth of madness and exciting travel adventure and I cannot wait to share the whole series with you. The web series releases on 15th June, and is very different from my other travel series thus far. Stay tuned and hope this Trailer excites you!

In this episode, I aim to highlight my progress as a beginner surfer in days. While day 4 felt a little disappointing. Day 5 was all about having fun and just letting go. Crashing many times and ultimately realising that it‚Äôs a sport that needs practice at many locations and a lot of patience to master. üòÄ

This season of Trying My Best is the Surfing for beginners edition! Also, I aim to try these new activities in India, because did you know that you don‚Äôt always have to travel abroad or spend insane amounts of money to fulfill all your wishes :)

 At Mulki, Karnataka, I took a 5 day surfing course with Indica Surf school. The closest airport near Mulki is Mangalore Airport. You can also take trains and buses to reach here. If you wish to contact Indica Surf school, feel free to reach out here:

Do you have any top 5 lists like this one? Tell me in the comments. 

Planning to travel abroad? Don‚Äôt ever leave your place without these 5 things:
‚ú® Passport and visa (well obviously, but just in case you‚Äôre forgetful while packing, please pack your passport first)
‚ú® Travel insurance. This is an absolute must in current times and even generally to cover your trip for medical, trip-related, baggage related, passport loss and other coverages.
‚ú® Universal travel adapter! Please don‚Äôt forget this or you‚Äôll be stranded while travelling without being able to charge your phone.
‚ú® Currency and cards with international transactions turned on. You know for the longest time I couldn‚Äôt use one of my best credit cards while travelling because I forgot to turn on international transactions on it from my bank website? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
‚ú® Pack for different weather conditions! I‚Äôve especially realised how handy this tip was while travelling from the US to Peru. It was extremely hot in NYC and Peru is on the colder side! Also, I‚Äôm so glad I packed my hiking shoes from India before leaving.

Hope this helps! Follow and save for more!

This is a very offbeat tourist destination that I visited recently. And I'm extremely excited to share what went down in this extremely adventurous trip. I did an 11-day self-drive camping trip and I think I'll remember it for a lifetime now. 

IN THIS VIDEO I'm basically sharing what it was like when I first landed in Namibia. Visiting a new country can be pretty overwhelming. And even though I travel often, I feel like backing out too. But nothing like setting foot in an all-new place, getting done with some basics like withdrawing cash and a local sim and starting on a great note. 

Some additional info:
- Namibia's currency is called Namibian dollars or N$
- N$1 = 4.73 INR
- The local sim is from a company called MTC and if you get an Aweh bundle, the internet is pretty cheap. The total combination cost me N$200 whereas just 3GB recharge costs N$65
- I use an international debit card and credit card both while travelling. But I use a debit card to withdraw money. 
- The cab that I was boarding at the end of the video was arranged by the hotel that I was staying at in Windhoek. To be covered in the next part. 
- Ethiopian Airlines are pretty decent and safe for travelling all over Africa. I'd surely recommend it!
- This video is sponsored by realme. I hope you like the photos from the phone, and can consider buying it if you are looking to get a new phone!

Namibia is one of the most amazing countries I have ever been to. And I had one day in Windhoek before the start of a crazy travel, driving, camping adventure, to get a good sense of the place. So here's a vlog from day 1! Just 10 more days of camping to go XD

Some additional info:
- Namibia's currency is called Namibian dollars or N$

- N$1 = 4.73 INR

- The local sim is from a company called MTC and if you get an Aweh bundle, the internet is pretty cheap. The total combination cost me N$200 whereas just 3GB recharge costs N$65

- I use an international debit card and credit card both while travelling. But I use a debit card to withdraw money. 

- The cab that I'm using in the video is managed by wildplanets.com  

- The whole experience is in collaboration with Wild Planets, which is a not for profit company. They contribute most of their earnings from Tourism towards the development of Africa. So, if you're planning to travel to Africa, do give them a holler. 

- Mr. Munshi is the founder of Wild Planets and on this trip I had the good fortune of finding out first hand from him about Namibia. Wild Planets will launch their tours in Namibia in 2020.

The whole trip took me close to 5 hours. But for me and my aunt (Madhur Masi), we took quite a lot of little stops. The whole distance is close to 13 km and can be easily completed in 1.5 hours. 

The bike rental costed $32/person for the full day

There‚Äôs no cash limit to other currencies like dollars, Euros, pounds etc. when leaving india. Note that, limits may apply, during immigration of the country you‚Äôre visiting, so check before travelling and carry cash accordingly.

Also, please note, that you must avoid exchanging currency at the airports because the exchange rates are usually not favourable.

For foreign nations, bringing Indian currency to India is not allowed.",116555,6263,54

You may know of this village already for it‚Äôs igloos, but I'll take you there in the third episode of this season.

‚ú® You may have to connect with the tourism department to stay overnight in Bangus valley. It is easier to do so around the Bangus Mela. You can stay updated with the dates through google.
‚ú® However here‚Äôs someone from the tourism department who you can connect with - Mr Farooq Shah: +91 70068 18600
‚ú® Best way of getting here is taking a taxi and staying overnight in Handwara.

Found this place in south Goa and coincidentally it‚Äôs called üìçMini Parra road! I thought that was pretty funny because the first road that was popularised by Dear Zindagi, which sort of looks like this, is called Parra road. And now it is a tourist hotspot where everybody throngs for that perfect selfie/photo. Thankfully this was completely empty during the golden hour.",109684,7119,106

Until one day it happened! This is a series that recounts memoirs of how this trip truly went along with Namrata (@Namrata Menon ) and the people who we met along the way of our 2000 mile drive. :) 

We rented a car from Hertz rentals in Los Gatos, California, which helped us drive and explore easily across the state of California. My dear friend Namrata who joined me on this trip is not only a friend but also a great cinematographer. This series is shot by her. 
Her Insta handle is - @radxbone

Now of course you'll assume I'm only saying this because I'm working with the tourism board for this video. But see it for yourself. We have Yas Island which is the amusement park hum of UAE, we have The Lurve here, Al Jubail Mangrove park, Al Wathba fossil dunes and so many beautiful beaches. It made me feel like royalty throughout, and the cherry on top of the cake was my first-ever skydiving experience. If you ever want to try it as well, Abu Dhabi has to be your choice of destination. Here is some practical information for you though:

1. The flight from India is just 4 hours if you fly with one of UAE's airlines like Etihad. 

2. The visa can be applied online and it is a simple e-visa process that takes 3-7 working days to process. 

3. The currency conversion is 1 AED = ‚Çπ 22.26

4. If you want to book cabs online, you can opt for the app Careem for doing so. However, the cheaper option is taking cabs from the curbside. 
Believe me, it can almost give you a 10-20 AED worth of difference. 

5. Here is the cost of all activities shown in the video:

‚óè Qasr-Al-Hosn entry fee = AED 65 
‚óè Aquarium entry fee = AED 105 
‚óè Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque = free admission
‚óè Lourve admission fee = AED 63 
‚óè Ferrari world (when booked online) = AED 325
‚óè Skydiving with photos/videos = AED 1600 
‚óè Al Wathba Fossil Dunes = free admission
‚óè Kayaking at Jubail Mangrove Park = AED 130 

Taxi cost in going from one place to another to give you an idea: 

‚óè St Regis to Qasr-Al Hosn = AED 26.56 
‚óè Qasr-Al-Hosn to National Aquarium = AED 68
‚óè National Aquarium to Sheikh Zayed Mosque = AED 29
‚óè St. Regis to W Abu Dhabi = AED 101

Hope this helps you plan your trip!
