Hutheesing Jain Temple:
Hutheesing Jain Temple is one amongst these historical complexes which add on to the existing beauty of Ahmedabad due to their wonderful architecture and religious significance. So, let's learn more about this Jain temple which has been alluring tourists for decades.
Located in the city of Ahmedabad in Gujarat, Hutheesing Jain Temple was constructed in 1848 and is dedicated to Lord Dharmanath, the fifteenth Jain Tirthankar. The plan of building a grand temple was initiated by ShetHathisinhKesarisinh. Unfortunately, he died before the completion of the temple and hence, his wife had to come forward to complete the formation of Hutheesing Jain Temple. Designed by the architect PremchandSalat, this wonderful masterpiece costed more than a million dollars at that time which was a huge sum in the 19th century. The sheer dedication of the architect and artisans is reflected over the beautiful walls and designs of the temple. It took around 2 years to complete the overall formation.

Surando is an ancient folk musical instrument of Kutch. Surando is a stringed musical instrument played with the use of Bow, Gaz or Gazi in local dialect. The body of the instrument is made of all sorts of wood, but to serve as an excellent sound chamber Lahirro wood is the best one. Talhi, Bahan and Mango wood rank second, third and forth in importance. The Bow or Gaz is comprised of strings of horse's hair or gut fastened to each of a flexible stick. The Bow is placed on the strings at right angles to it and is moved back and forth across it. Producing sound with the help of the bow in friction with the strings is a more advanced skill than plucking. Strings are tuned to a proper frequency by tuning the pegs on the instruments.

        A Surando has six strings - five of steel and the sixth of copper and each strings has specific name like Agor,Tip,Jaraetc..Surando known in Kutch is believed to have been well known as Sarinda in northern parts of India and in Sind of Pakistan. Surando is played like Sarangi and it is similar to Sarangi and Violin. Surando is prepared artistically getting intricate carving from the single piece of teak wood. It is given a pea-cock shape. To get decorative impression of Surando, the tiny nails of brass can be fixed on its surface. It is also painted with colors prepared from mercury or zinc for attractive show.

The old city of Ahmedabad located on the Eastern banks of the Sabarmati river is made up of around 360 pols within a fortified compound. The earliest ‘Pol’ to be incorporated was aptly christened ‘Mahurat Pol’ and was built adjacent to Manek Chowk.



UNESCO has declared Ahmedabad as a world heritage site, thereby becoming the first Indian city to get this status.
With huge courtyards- A Gujarati household essential, intricately carved wooden facades and frescoes and colourful exteriors, the pols were not only bright and lively but also strategically built for safety and security during the war. Along with having a front entrance, each Pol had a back entrance for the women and children to escape to the labyrinth of lanes that connected the pols whereas the men used the front entrance to face and negotiate with the enemy. Ever since then, these Pols have harbored life and culture and given way towards the urban lifestyle. Most of the people living in the Pol are cottage industry workers and can be found sitting on the charpoy (cot) in their courtyards, stitching, binding books, sewing etc. The nonchalant Gujrati chatter that falls upon your ears is interesting to decipher, but perhaps what is more intriguing are the bemusing names of these pols and the stories behind them. The 19th-century laureate Poet Dalpatram, notable for Gujarati and Sanskrit poems would welcome you to his house in the Kavi Dalpatram Chowk in Lambeshwar ni Pol, as he sits in the huge paved courtyard in the form of a glimmering bronze statue, installed by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. Just ahead through the tangle of bylanes is a murky well surrounded by shabby rooms on either side. The well was the primary source of water for the nearby pols until it was shut in 1962 by WHO officials stating that the water was unhealthy. Not surprisingly, this pol was named as the Kuawala Khancha Doshiwada Ni pol which literally translates into the salty water well pol.

Ahmedabad is the largestcity in the state of Gujarat. It is located in western India on the banks of the River Sabarmati. The city served as political as well as economical capital of the region since its establishment. The earliest settlement can be recorded around the 12th century under Chaulukya dynasty rule. The present city was founded on 26 February 1411 and announced as the capital on 4 March 1411 by Ahmed Shah I of Gujarat Sultanate as a new capital. Under the rule of sultanate (1411–1511) the city prospered followed by decline (1511–1572) when the capital was transferred to Champaner. For next 135 years (1572–1707), the city renewed greatness under the early rulers of Mughal Empire. The city suffered due to political instability (1707–1817) under late Mughal rulers followed by joint rule between Maratha and Mughal. The city further suffered following joint Maratha rule. The city again progressed when politically stabilized when British East India Company established the rule in the city (1818–1857). The city further renewed growth when it gain political freedom by establishment of municipality and opening of railway under British crown rule (1857–1947). Following arrival of Mahatma Gandhi in 1915, the city became centre stage of Indian independence movement. Many activists like Sardar Patel served the municipality of the city before taking part in the movement. After independence, the city was a part of Bombay state. When Gujarat was carved out in 1960, it again became the capital of the state until establishment of Gandhinagar in 1965. Ahmedabad is also the cultural and economic calcentre of Gujarat and the seventh largest city of India.

Its deep sea port was built during the last quarter of the 20th century. The name Porbandar came from the two words: """"Porai"""" and """"Bandar"""". Porai is the name of a local goddess, and """"Bandar"""" means port or harbour. Thus, `Porbandar` means `Porai`s port. According to history, it shows that Porbandar was inhabited by Harappan settlement dating back to the 16th - 14th century BC.  There are proofs that the Harappan legacy of maritime activity continued till the late Harappan period on the Saurashtra coast. The findings ancient jetties along the Porbandar stream are certain significant evidences that highlight the importance of the city as an active centre of maritime activities in the past.

Uttarayan is a kite flying festival celebrated across Gujarat. Witness and participate in this festival while you are in Gujarat during the month of January. 


A festival that marks the transition of winter to summer and also the beginning of Harvest season. The International Kite Festival is among the most prominent festivals that are celebrated in Gujarat. Ahmedabad, where the main event takes place, becomes an abode for visitors from all over the world. During the week leading up to the International Kite Festival, the local markets are flooded with numerous kite buyers and kite sellers. The most popular kite market is the Patang Bazaar, which stays open for 24 hours a day during this festival.

Various cities across Gujarat hold kite flying competitions among its citizens. However, the showstopper contest, the International Kite Event, is held in Ahmedabad. Ahmedabad is also known as the Kite Capital of Gujarat. It is believed that the Sabarmati Riverfront, with a capacity to accommodate over 5 lakh visitors, is the best place to witness and enjoy the festival. A bunch of tourists also prefers the Ahmedabad Police Stadium. People make themselves comfortable and lie down to get a view of the sky that is filled with hundreds of thousands of kites.

Main Attractions of the International Kite Festival of Gujarat:
Nationals of over 45 countries participate in this one of a kind event. They consider it to be more of a battle and less friendly competition. Kites of all shapes, sizes and designs are flown throughout the day. Participants also have their favourite kite makers who they turn to for strong and resilient kites which they can fly on this special event. The string, also called Manjha in the local language, is specially made by combining glue and glass over its fibre. The string is prepared to be as sharp as possible so that it is easy to cut rival kites during the competition. The excitement fails to die even after a long day of kite flying. Lanterns are attached to the string or manjha, and the kites are continued to be flown. This makes for a spectacular night view of the festival as well.

History of the International Kite Festival
Kite flying was a common hobby in the streets of India. However, the ruling nawabs of that period took it up as a major sport. They looked at it as an opportunity to compete with each other and display their strengths. It was also considered to be highly entertaining. With time, the competition grew very serious, and there were varied kinds of kites and individual strings being made for the participants. Invitations were sent out to expert kite makers and kite flyers from all across the globe to exhibit their kite flying prowess and beat all competition. The tradition continues to this date, and the International Kite Flying Festival is held every year in Gujarat.

The considerable participation and the number of varieties of kites flown in the International Kite Festival, make it a unique event that unites passionate kite flyers from across the globe to network and collaborate. The entire skyline is decorated with different kinds and colours of kits and presents a sight to behold. Visitors can plan a relaxed picnic in the backdrop of this colourful festival or can also participate and fly kits along with family. Either way, the International Kite Festival promises a memorable time.

133,UC7Q1wQXsdCOs1OakD7yb-TA,-Xguc11rU8U,2020-01-13T08:16:27Z,#MORCHANG – Also known as “The Jaw Harp”,"Morchang is the most favourite instrument for Langa community of Rajasthan, a wrought iron instrument, much akin to the Jews harp, which produces twanging sounds.
Structure

It consists of a metal ring in the shape of a horseshoe with two parallel forks which form the frame, and a metal tongue in the middle, between the forks, fixed to the ring at one end and free to vibrate at the other. The metal tongue is bent at the free end in a plane perpendicular to the circular ring so that it can be struck and is made to vibrate. This bent part is called the trigger.

#Technique
The morchang is placed between the teeth and held firmly in the hand and is struck using the other hand to produce sound. Movement of the player''s tongue, variations of the throat and blowing and sucking of air through the instrument produces different sounds or overtones.

The morchang is firmly held in the hand, the frame or the ring between the palm and the fingers usually in the left hand. Care should be taken to see that the middle part or the metal tongue is not being touched when held idle. Then the two parallel forks are gently pressed against the front upper teeth. The trigger is plucked with the tip of the index finger. Sound is produced due to the vibration of the metal tongue of the morsing in the mouth and the throat cavity. Movement of the player''s tongue with constant plucking can produce very fast patterns of sound. By constricting the space in the mouth and throat many variations of sound can be produced.

She is often referred to as Arasuri Amba, named for the location of the temple in the Arasur hills, near the source of the Saraswati river at the south-western end of the Aravali mountain range. Being one of the oldest and most revered temples of ancient India, there are many enthralling legends and myths attached to this temple. Each story intensifies the brilliance of the goddess and the faith of a devotee. There is no idol of the goddess, perhaps because the temple is so ancient that it predates idol-worship, but the priests decorate the upper portion of the main temple structure, gokh, in such a way that it looks like an idol of a goddess from a distance.

Be sure to look across the temple (i.e. with your back facing the goddess) at the other temple on the Gabbar, considered the original abode of the goddess. At a short distance from the Ambaji temple is a large rectangular kund, with steps on all its four sides, called Mansarovar.""
