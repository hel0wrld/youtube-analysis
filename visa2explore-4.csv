Market  starts from Red Fort and goes upto Daryaganj. This is a 2 km long stretch where you can get to buy - shoes, Watches, DSLR, electronics , jeans and much more.

Chor bazar starts at 4 am in morning every Sunday and goes on till 4 pm evening. I reached here at 5 am and was amazed to discover that thousand of buyers were already there.

How to reach chor bazar Delhi.
Travelling by metro- Get down at chandni chowk metro station if you are travelling from Gurgaon or Jahangirpuri side.

Get down at Red fort station if you are travelling from Faridabad side.

If you are travelling to Delhi through interstate bus, then you can get down at Kashmere gate ISBT , take a auto and come down to Red fort chor bazar, its hardly 2 kms distance from there.

Things to be careful of when going to Chor bazar of Delhi.

1. Be careful of your belongings, like mobile and purse. This place is very crowded.

2. Test before buying, we bought pen drive without testing and found that to be fake. Deo also we found to be fake. I also bought 2 bags, which I found to be good value for money.

3. You can also buy used electronics - like TV, laptop, more over some people also sell computer accessories like hard drive, USB cables etc.

4. I found 2 people who were selling 2nd hand video camera at competitive price. Seller had thorough knowledge of camera features and was ready to get it tested before selling it to us.

I have a JVC video cam at home, which is not of any use for me. I spoke to one of the sellers and he got ready to buy from me for Rs 1000, which means you can also sell your old electronics here at chor bazar.

5. You will also get to see some people selling cameras here, golden rule is check and test before buying any second hand item.

6. Shoes, jeans - I saw many people selling brands at cheap rates, that is merely copy with illegal labels. I don't see any merit in buying shoes just for the heck of showing the brand, when comfort will not be there of a good branded shoe.

7. You will experience high negotiation on prices, visit to Chor bazar  will certainly enhance your negotiation skills.

From over all experience perspective - If you are in Delhi or travelling to Delhi, its a must visit market, I am sure lot of learnings will evolve around the way markets behave. 

Over all there will be compromise in product quality, buy from there only if you are super sure that you are buying the right product at right price

Distance from Katra to Adhkuwari - approx 5.5 km via old route and approx 7 km via new route Tarakote marg.

Adhkuwari to Bhawan - approx 5.5 km via the battery car route and approx 6 km via Sanj chatt.

For Battery van: 
This journey is between Adhkuwari and Bhawan
There are 2 things:
A. They promote it for people who cannot walk or are old.
B. It is better that you have pre booking - they give priority for people who do online booking... https://www.maavaishnodevi.org/


My recommendation/suggestions if you are planning to travel to Vaishodevi.

Book your stay accomodation in advance in katra as well as mid way either in Adhkuwari or Bhawan. 

Get your yatra parchi online to avoid que.
If you are planning to travel by helicopter you need to book in advance, it will take you to sanjichatt and from there you will have to walk down to Bhawan - distance of 2.5 km. cost rs 1045 per passenger. Camera is not allowed in helicopter.

Best time to travel : Jan and february as during this time, less people travel, you will enjoy more. If you travel between 15th jan and 20th february, there is a high chance that you may get to visit old Gufa at Bhawan, Plus keep in mind that you should avoid weekends. Because if there are more yatri’s on any day , they close the old Gufa.

You can also look at clubbing vaishno devi yatra with shiv khori and patnitop, you can see other videos for additional information.

Should you  have any query related to this yatra, please feel free to ask that in comment below, I will look forward to hearing back from you in this regard.

This is the 5th Jyotirlinga of Lord Shiva.  This video is a summary of 2 day travel. We started the yatra from Sonprayag and went to Shri Kedarnath Dham and came back to Sonprayag. We did night stay near Triyuginarayan temple.

You may explore our merchandise on kadamerch, link below:
https://kadakmerch.com/collections/visa2explore

During my travel there in May 2019 - I noticed Vodafone and BSNL have network coverage at Kedarnath Dham.

Imp information:
There is a cloak room at Sonprayag, i showed that in previous episode Bhiri to Triyuginarayan.

Later on i realised walking on Galcier or snow was risky, i should have avoided, i will strongly suggest you to avoid walking at areas where there is a slope, just a slight miss and one will fall and this may be life threatening.

Following is the summary of distance to be traveled in this yatra.

Sonprayag to Gauri kund: 5 km, Rupees 20 per person on jeep.

Gauri Kund to Kedarnath ji: 16.5 km. 

Base camp is 1 km short of Shri Kedarnath temple. Garhwal mandal vikas nigam has their Guest house and tent facility at Base camp.

While its not impossible to go and come back in a day to Sonprayag but difficulty level is high especially if  you don’t  have high energy level.

Services for travel to Kedarnath ji:

You can take helicopter services that cost around 6000, this can vary between 5000 to 8000 depending upon the distance from Sonprayag. Flight time from a place near Sonprayag to Kedarnath ji is 6 to 8 minutes.

Helipad is at a half a km from Shri Kedarnath Temple.

If you want to hire a porter or a person with a basket or if an old person wish someone to carry him on Doli, these facilities are readily available.

Pony: Yes you can travel on Pony too - charges Rs 2500 one side, if you decide to walk down and mid way feel that you need to take pony for this travel, then you can still get Pony for rest of the journey.

In my suggestion: It’s better to walk down, only thing you should be physically fit to do this trek of 17 km, as some places the trek is steep. 

Best time to travel to Kedarnath ji - 15th August to 30th September. 
Avoid travel in the month  of May because its crowded.

Note: Try to book at Garhwal mandal guest house, there accomodation is neat and clean in comparison to other facilities available there. You can do the booking by visiting their website.  http://gmvnl.in/newgmvn/index.aspx

We went there without any pre booking, it was May month we had to pay rs 4000 for double occupancy room, though that could accomodate 4 people as well. In fact demand for room in May month is much more than supply.

Things to carry: You can carry food, water bottle or just anything else you want to carry because food, water and everything else is expensive on the yatra route. For example a glass of Lemon water would cost Rs 20. A water bottle on the yatra route would cost Rs 50.

If you want to eat Maggi it would cost Rs 80 or so.

……………………………………………………………………………………….
Biometric registration:  Initially i was wondering what is the need for Biometric registration when no body is actually checking it at the entry gate and exit gate.

My take on this: It helps Government know the names and addresses of people who were doing Yatra during a particular time of the month...At the time of registration they ask you about number of days for which you want to travel. There is no hard and fast rule that you  should follow that only…

One reason of course is to keep information about people who are travelling and other resaon is that if there is a mishappening on the yatra route and government wants to give some compensation, they can use this database for reference purpose.

Though exact number of people travelling on yatra route cannot be ascertained but this can work as an indicator.

Hope you are enjoying watching our Uttarakhand Char Dham yatra series, if you have missed watching any episode, i will suggest you to look at the playlist.

Should you have any query about this yatra route, please feel free to write your query in comments below.
Night stay options for  going to Shri Kedarnath Dham:

Sonprayag: Very crowded place, i will not recommend you to stay at this place.

Gaurikund: 5 km from Sonprayag, very crowded place, you should avoid staying here over night.

night stay option 5 or 10 km before Sonprayag: Yes there are many guest houses which are 5 or 10 km short of Sonprayag.

Triyuginarayan: Good option 13 km from Sonprayag, but you should do booking at GMVL at Triyuginarayan, there not not many guest houses at this place, i mean the neat and clean ones.

Thanks for your time.",7348468,101222,4598

We travelled through various film shooting sets, like Bahubali film set, I also got to see the place where famous song Dirty film of Ooh la la was shot , Chennai express sets, Plus a  lot more.

You may want to support this channel: https://www.patreon.com/visa2explore 

Some of my personal favourite film shooting  sets in this visit:

Bahubali sets: This left us zapped, we felt for a moment as if we were in Mahishmati kingdom.

Airport set: Again felt as if we are at an airport, they made it so well.

Hospital set: Just write the name hospital of board outside and you are ready to shoot.

Central jail: It was exactly like what we see in Bollywood or Indian films.

We were lucky that we visited Ramoji film studio during the last week of Janurary 2018, We could enjoy the carnival.

Ticket price per person is Rs 1250 without food.
Ticket price per person including food Rs 2250

Above tickets include bus journey, Tickets counters close at 2 pm.

Ramoji film city is huge in size 1666 acres, someone told me 2000 acres which is incorrect.

Recommendation:

Basis my experience, you may feel like spending 2 days at Ramoji but even if you want to cover this in one day, you can do that but then you get little time to spend in each of the sets.

Ideally you should reach Ramoji by 8.15 or 8.30 am and spend full day there.

Plus it is always better and advisable to visit Ramoji film city during carnival time, you may check the details on their website or speak to them on their call center: 180042509999.

http://www.ramojifilmcity.com/daytour/index

We missed to explore ramoji movie magic area because we reached there one hour late, activities in that area close at 2.30 pm. 

My advice is that you should plan your Ramoji film city tour well before you travel. This will help you get a good feel of how film studios are made and it's like behind the scene looks of sets.

Thanks for your time, Do share your travel experiences about Ramoji film city. I would love to hear back from you in this regard.

Distances between:
Ramoji and Hyderabad: 30 kms, 1 hour drive.
Ramoji and Hyderabad airport: 40 kms 1 hour and 15 min drive.

I traveled from Delhi to Manali in mid July 2017 for 6 days. During the 6 day period, i have tried covering every tourist attraction in Manali.

This video should help you plan your itinerary for Manali- Himachal pradesh

Volvo busses from Delhi start in the evening between 5 pm and7 pm. Travel time from Delhi to Manali is between 12 to 14 hours. My bus started at 7.30 pm from Delhi- RK Ashram, we reached Manali next day at 10.30 am

I got reference of Royal travels through a friend, so i got my To & fro journey booked from them.

https://www.royalindia.travel/ - You can check with them if you are interested to travel from Delhi to Manali
Details of the day wise itinerary is given below:

Day 1: Trip to solang  valley plus vashisht temple.

Manali to solang valley is about 10 kms, it takes 20 to 25 minutes to reach there. Solang valley is popular for paragliding. There are 3 to 4 types of  flight starting from Rs 1000 to Rs 3200 depending upon the height you are flying from.

During winters, you can enjoy skiing at Solang valley.

Pilot with whom i did paragliding:  Ram chand: 9816170161
 
Vashishth temple: In the evening time i travelled to vashishth temple, which is about 6 kms from Manali. Rishi Vashishth is one of the 7 saptrishi as per Hindu religion.

Many people who have skin infection get cured automatically after bath in the kund at Vashishth temple.

Day 2:  Trip to Manikaran

Manali to Manikaran is about 80 kms, it takes about 3 hours to reach there. You can take a HImachal tourism bus from Manali bus stand or take a bike on rent or taxi on rent to travel to Manikaran.

This place has a popular Gurudwara plus a shiv temple and a hot water spring

Day 3: Visit to Bijli mahadev temple: There are two ways you can travel to Bijli Mahadev temple.
Through kullu: This route involves a trek of 3 kms which can take little more than 1 hour. Even if this involves trek, then also it is route that one should follow when going to Bijli Mahadev temple.
Through Jana waterfall: Distance between manali and Jana waterfall is 35 kms. From Jana waterfall to Bijli Mahadev temple is 24 kms. This  route is a complete off track. You should avoid this  route if you cannot undertake off road bike drive. One should avoid this unless you are very sure of biking skils.

Day 4: Local sightseeing:

Jogini waterfall: I thought to spending Day 4 of the journey doing local sightseeing, 1st half  of the day i travelled to Jogini waterfall, you will need to do trek of about 40 minutes from Vashishth temple for going to Jogini waterfall.

Manu temple: Photography inside the temple was not allowed, so i showed this temple from outside. This temple is dedicated to the sage Manu, who is believed to be the creator of world. This is the only temple of Sage manu. It is located in old Manali.

Hadimba temple: This  is located at a distance of about 2 kms from Mall road. It is believed that Hadimba did meditation in the cave at this place. This is a must visit place in Manali.

After the temple visit - i decided to do night stay at a camp, which was near Kalath, landmark near green tax barrier.

It costed Rs 1000 per day per day per person. Name of the coman who manages this is into the wild himalayas: http://www.intowildhimalaya.com/ 

Day 5: Rohtang pass: 

Rohtang pass is 50 kms from Manali. It takes about 3 hours to reach there. You can travel to Rohtang on Himachal tourism bus or take a taxi from manali to Rohtang.

It costs about Rs 4000 to travel on a small taxi like Alto in off season. In season - which is summers May and june travel to Rohtang cost Rs 6000 or so.

Day 6: 
Naggar palace: This is about 20 kms from Manali, old house of Royal family.

Hamta pass: This is about 20 kms from Manali. You need to take permission from SDM office for going to Hamta pass. You can go there on heavy motor bike or on SUV vehicle, turns are sharp, 43 curves out over there.

At the end of Day 6 i travelled back from Manali to Delhi in evening, bus started at 6.30 pm and i reached back Delhi at 7.30 am. 

Most of the local travel in Manali was done on Motor bike, which i got on hire from Blacksheep..

You may contact them if needed: 9459903529 - Shitij. Their office is at Vashishth chowk.

My recommendation on places to eat:

The corner house: Mall road Manali- opposite SDM office.
Nirvana restaurant: Near Vashisht temple.

Travelling cost:  Refer to EP 1 description section on how below cost is calculated.

Min cost to reach Gangtok: Rs 500.
Hotel: Rs 1500 per day.
Food Rs 500 one meal
Total cost of Day 0: Rs 2500

Day1 : Cab for local sightseeing  for 8 hours Rs 2500.
You may want to take share cab for point to point travelling but then you can't travel to all tourist destinations. 

Example from MG marg you can take a share cab for trolley point by paying Rs 20.. but you can't go to Hanuman Tok on share cab as on that route no share cab.,

OLA and uber taxi service not available.

you : can take cab for travelling from one point to another , but that's expensive they charge anything from Rs 200 to Rs 400...

Day 1 : 
cab : 2500
food 1000
hotel: 1500
Total cost of Day 1: Rs 5000.
Above cost will apply for Day 0 and Day 1 will be 2500 plus 5000 equals to 7500.

I paid much higher cost because i had exclusive taxi all the time, i stayed in 3 category hotel which was expensive.


As always i love to read your comments and reply back on them… thanks for your time…

Distance from Gangotri to Gaumukh: This is a total distance of 18 km, with break up as…

Time Duration:We did this Trek from Gangotri to Gaumukh over 2 days, we stayed overnight at Bhojbasa.

Journey dates: 1st week of June 2019.

Permit process: You need to apply online for Gaumukh permit using the below weblink.. http://swsuttarkashi.com/Permission/GangotriNationalPark

Application for permit does not mean confirmation of travel on that day, you still need to visit the forest office day before or few days before the journey and get the day of travel confirmation done.


Charge for permit: You don’t have to pay anything online - when you reach forest office entry gate at Gangotri , you have to pay  charge of Rs 150 per person.

Charge for Pony service: Government approved rate is Rs 1800 per person from Gangotri Forest entry gate to Bhojbasa and back next day.

Though Rs 1800 rate is fixed by government but on an average this costs Rs 2500 because they will charge extra for luggage plus if you are little over over normal weight they will charge extra. Consider this about Rs 2500 per person.

Guide charge: We paid Rs 2500 to our guide, Ideally you should fix your guide day before the journey, if you want only porter you may get it at Rs 2000 for the complete journey.

In our case Guide demanded Rs 2500 for his service then Rs 1000 extra for his boarding and lodging - we paid Rs 3500 to him for this 2 day journey.

In this route most guides work as Guide cum porter but still you should clarify this with the guide.

Food at Garhwal Mandal vikas Nigam Guest house Bhojbasa- They serve good and tasty food, though options are limited, only veg food available.

Dal, Bharta or Bhindi average one person serving costs Rs 170 to Rs 190.

Tea in morning - you can get it at 6 am in morning at Bhojbasa.

Places to stay between Gangotri to Gaumukh: Only place where you can stay is Bhojbasa, there are 2 options there GMVN , you need to do online booking.  There is no place to stay at Gaumukh.

Per person stay cost Rs 350 excluding food.

Other option is there is a ashram near GMVN , you can stay there as well at cost of Rs 350 per person. This cost at Ashram includes food cost, they serve langar there.

Electricity at Bhojbasa - There is no electricity over there, GMVN guest house has a generator which they run every day evening for one and a half hour.

Mobile network: You will get mobile network only for 2 to 3 km during the start of the journey, then no network, even BSNL network was not there.

If there is some emergency, GMVN people liasons with the Army there and communicates wirelessly with Gangotri.

Things to carry: Enough woolens, raincoat, oxygen cylinder, you can get oxygen cylinder from gangotri medical shop by paying Rs 600 and if it is not used they will deduct Rs 100 or 200 and return the balance money. 

Its not compulsory to carry oxygen cylinder but just on a safe side.

Should you have any other query, please read through frequently asked questions below.

FAQ -
Can i travel from Gangotri to Gaumukh and then come back on the same day to Gangotri.

Answer - Yes you can do that, as i did the same 6 years back when i went there with my wife but you need high physical fitness and good stamina. Though it is not advisable, as by the time you reach back Gangotri it will be dark.

Can i start trek early morning at 4 am?
Answer -No, Forest department allows entry from the gate at 6 am, to reach Forest entry gate you should start from you hotel or guest house at Gangotri at 5.30 am or 5.15 am..

Can i travel to Gaumukh in winters?
Answer - No - You can go there during May to Oct period only, during winters Gangotri National park is closed.

Benefit of taking guide?
Answer - He can guide you about danger zone, and give you good company. They are not professional guides, they were porters at some point of time and now have graduated themselves to guide.

Best time to travel to Gaumukh?

Answer - Mid august to end september. May and October will be cold. Though you can travel any time between May to Oct but avoid Monsoon time between June to July.

Is travel on Pony safe?
Answer - To my mind it is not advisable, because if you slip from Pony, it may badly hurt you or there may be a casualty too because it is steep below and passage is also small…

Though the number of travelers per day is limited so there is no crowd there but i will still suggest try walking down and you will love the journey.",3876949,48246,2494

Price: Four Mix kulcha: Rs 75

Address: Bazar Bikanerian, Near Golden Temple, Amrtisar.

5.  Singhik View Point, Mangan

You will get to see beautiful scenic view from this point.
We went there in Monsoon weather we could not see the Mt. Kanchenjunga, otherwise from this point, Mount kanchenjunga can be seen clearly.

We did this journey through a local travel agency, its name is Tamu travels… Lalit is the owner:

Tamu Tour and travels
Development area, Gangtok east Sikkim.
http://www.tamutourandtreks.com/

9832564013
9002069916.

This journey from Gangtok to North Sikkim then west and south Sikkim for us was about 7 nights and 8 days.. It costed us Rs 35k…
35k is only for taxi for 8 days.

Other costs are extra. This 8 day journey is for North, south and west Sikkim. We paid Rs 2500 for taxi per day in Gangtok, that was for 8 hours.. they charge extra if you hire beyond 8 hours..

we virtually ended up paying about Rs 3300 to 3500 per day for local sight seeing bcoz we had taxi with full for full day early morning to late evening.

This complete complete journey from Gangtok to Lachen in North sikkim took us about 13 hours….

Reason it took time was bcoz we stopped for food, shoot took time plus every 30 minutes we took break to see and enjoy the beauty…

If you want to plan this journey, i will suggest you to get your bookings done properly because it involves permit.

We did this journey during last week of June 2018, which is an off season time…

Important note for this journey: 
Avoid rainy season.
Travel in either feb or March or in oct and nov to enjoy sikkim the most.

Check with your travel agent on the fact whether can travel to North sikkim or not because some of the routes are closed because of snow.

Cost for minimum low cost travel two and a half days in Gangtok will be about Rs 11000 - details in description of previous episodes of Gangtok:

Taxi cost for travel to North or other regions of Sikkim: Rs 3500 per day, for certain cost moment you are 2 people cost goes high. for example i have put 400 fare from siliguri to Gangtok for one person so you have to adjust if you are two.

Food Rs 1500
hotel: Rs 2000

For every day that you travel in Sikkim minimum cost will be Rs 7000.

North sikkim i don't think you can travel by bus, i am not sure, suggest check with some one else...but yes you can travel to other districts of sikkim by bus, check details with tourism office in MG marg Gangtok for details.

MG marg is the place which is heart of Gangtok, try taking a hotel near MG marg.

Sikkim is over all expensive, so be sure on costs bcoz your budgets can over shoot, especially if you are going in peak season. Cost that you are see are of off season, during season every thing is atleast 30 percent higher on cost...

If you have any experience of sikkim travel, do share that in comments below. I would look forward to hear back from you in this regard.

We also got opportunity to explore taste of mountains, we stopped on the route to enjoy local food of hills. When you will travel on this route you will notice mind blowing scenic views, you should definitely keep buffer time to stop at these place and take some  pics for memory of lifetime.

Journey from Uttarakashi to Harsil is packed with natural beauty of hills.
Biometric regitration: During the whole journey, no one checked our Bio metric registration. As understood by me, there are 2 reasons or need for biometric registration on the yatra route.
1st-  It gives a rough estimate to government about how many people are there on the yatra route at any point of time. Though there is no entry gate or exit gate to check whether you have done it or not. They capture information like for how many days you are travelling and ofcourse your address details with id.

2nd reason - In an unlikely scenario, like the Kedarnath Dham 2013 incident where many people died because of natural calamilty, government would know the names and addresses of people who were there during the yatra route. This may not be 100 correct, unless they check it at entry and exit points of each Dham but still it will provide reasonable data. Something is better than nothing.

If you know of any 3rd reason for this, Do share the same in comment in this video.

Following are the details  of places visited by us during this Day 6 tour.

Khedi Waterfall : This waterfall can be best enjoyed between June to Aug ie during rainy season but i will not  suggest you to travel to hills during this time as its not safe, there may be landslides during this  period.

Sukhi Village: 
This is small village, generally nobody stops at this village because travellers stop at Ssukhi top whlich is one km from this village. Scenice views from Sukhi top are awesome.

We wanted to have local food, so we stopped here at this village. Dhaba where we had food is on the main road only at sukhil village.

Note : It is easier to get maggie on this route then to get Garhwali food, but yes they can serve it to you, provided you give them sometime. Actually i feel its so much about demand and supply. But yes i noticed some restaurants and dhaba on this route , have some options on local - pahadi food.

Just in case you have missed our Kolkata Series then watch it here: http://bit.ly/2Ogm6wM 

We got our tickets done from West Bengal tourism, ticket cost summary below. We did the journey in AC section.

1 Night 2 Days Tour

Non AC Berth Rs 4,730/ person +GST

All costs included in the above fare, like bus, food, guide, etc. 
Journey starts from Kolkata and ends in Kolkata. 

You may also want to do a 2 night and 3 day tour on ship, they have option for that as well.

If you are planning to travel with government you need to book in advance, plus journey dates are pre fixed.

In case Govt reservations are full for Sundarban Safari. Then you can take Private Boats too for Sundarban Safari. 

The charges for Private Boats can be approx Rs. 6,000 to 7,000 per person.
They also offer full day tour too. I don’t have any details to share with you but these are estimates that i got from few people.

Note: According to Govt rules small boats are not allowed for tour purpose plus it is not safe also.

You can do booking of the trip in advance through the below website and also connect with tourism office over phone for more information in this regard.

West Bengal Tourism: https://wbtourismgov.in/ 

P.S: You can’t get down to the forest area and do any safari there like there is no jeep safari or Elephant safari. Only way you travel to Sundarbans is by ship or large size boat….

Note: If you can carry Binoculars along you will enjoy this journey more. 
During April to Aug - West Bengal tourism does not operate ship tours to Sunderbans as it is hot and humid.

Peerah  is known for its Rajma Chawal serving with Desi Ghee, we went to a Random Shop, as it was on Highway, due to expansion of Highway, these shops will be relocated to some other place as informed by local over there.

Peerah rajma chawal - Rs  100 per plate.
Peerah is very famous for Rajma chawal as they serve it with ghee. We Travelled 30 km extra distance for Peerah Rajma chawal, but i think the experience and taste was worth the extra journey.

Paneer Pakoda: we halted 40 km short of jammu to have Paneer Pakoda, this is the place which was a lot visited by travellers when the old tunnel between Jammu and Srinagar was active but now with new tunnel in place, lesser people halt here.

people who know about this place still halt and enjoy the famous paneer pakoda at this place.

Hope you enjoyed watching this episode.

We did our first night stay at Himrol village, for which we went 30 km out of our char Dham route.

This is going to be a more than 20 episode series of Uttarakhand Tourist places, just in case if you miss any episode, just follow the Uttarakhand playlist on youtube channel: visa2explore.

We Started our Char Dham Yatra from Haridwar, we wanted to explore Garhwali food, folk dance, home stays etc. for which we had to extend our journey to 29 days, Usually people do this yatra - Haridwar to Haridwar in 9 days.

Following are the details of the places visited by us, which are part of this tour.

After dip in Holy Ganges, i enjoyed Poori Chole and Halwa at Mohan ji’s shop.

We passed through Yamuna bridge , got the opportunity to attend a marriage function at Himrol village, for this we went 30 km out of our Char Dham route. But this opportunity was really really good.

We stayed at a home stay at Himrol village, details below.

Himrol Village

Mr. Bharat owner of homestay: 9639827574.

We did this complete journey of Char Dham over 29 day period, hired Innova cab  from Gangotri travels- Haridwar. We paid per day cost of Rs 4500 inclusive of driver night stay.

Summary of my experience with Gangotri travels: Average experience - why?

They are over occupied with the business, when i called them during the journey to discuss about a issue that was bothering me, i noticed there was no one free to talk to me, i had to attempt it multiple times.

There is more to it then what meets the eye, i think this is the case with most of the agencies, they get over loaded with work in the month of May. God bless!!!

Would i prefer travelling again with Gangotri travels: To be honest i am not sure.

Important note: 

Drivers usually charge extra money for going to places like Mana village or Panch kedar or Panch Badri but for us it was all part of 4500 per day deal.

Best time to travel for char Dham yatra is mid august to september end. We did this journey from 13th May 2019 to 10th June 2019- this is not the best time, May means a lot of traffic jam. Mid June to 15th Aug is monsoon time - avoid hills.

Cost Details:
Innova Per day hire cost: Rs 4500.
Food per person Garhwali Thali Mussoorie: 300
Homestay tariff per person: Himrol village  Rs 1000 ( includes dinner & Breakfast).
Parking cost at Mussoorie: Rs 100.

At min cost basis it works out to Rs 6000 for Day 1. 

Overall Tour cost approx indicators:

Innova per day cost: Rs 4500.
Average per day meal cost per person: 800.
Average room tariff: Rs 1700 to Rs 2200. Generally on this route single person accommodation is not available, so solo travellers end up paying more.
Average parking cost per day: Rs 100 ( at Char Dham destinations).

Above costs are for the month of May till 15th June. Thereafter all costs generally drop by 20 to 30 percent.

Our cost was way too high,  there is so much in miscellaneous cost that occurs in any trip. Any ways above figures are indicators only.
Hope you enjoyed watching this first episode of Char Dham Yatra.",1831114,23300,1520

Police Bazaar, Shillong : This is heart of the city, though a high traffic area, but since there are food joints in the vicinity, so many travelers prefer to stay near Police bazar.

But in my own personal opinion, i would prefer to stay near Umiam lake, it is about 15 km short of Shillong, if you are travelling from Guwahati. It is a peaceful area but each place has its own pros and cons….

As you see our episodes you will get to learn about this and decide it for your own self.

I stayed in Shillong at Hotel Orchid Annex, this is situated at a distance of about 3 km from Police bazar, decent property, good customer service and nice spacious rooms.

Average room tariff at this hotel is Rs 3500 , then it goes up, i got a deal at Rs 2250 from make my trip, may be because i did booking at last minute…

If you have any query, with regard to your upcoming Meghalaya travel, pl. Feel free to ask me, i will be more than glad to share and reply back to your query.

After every few kms there are temples that you can visit - like Poonchari ki lautha, Jatipura Mukharbind, Radha kund-Shyamkund. 

Kusum sarovar - is not a temple but yes this is a beautiful scenic view spot with a nice lake that you will see on Parikarma route.

Since many people are not able to do Parikrama by foot, so they hire battery rickshwa and sit on it and get down at key temples only. Battery rickshaw guy charges around Rs 600 and you can do Parikrama on battery rickshaw in 2 to 3 hours max.

Lunch or dinner suggestion - I will suggest you to carry your own meal as places to eat during the route are not that hygienic.

We spotted a ashram of Benami cement , which is half a km before Jatipur Mukharbind, not many people will know about this , they have not even put  a board outisde.

They have a bhojanalaya where you can go and have lunch and dinner, specific 3 hour lunch and 3 hour dinner timings, you may have to wait for your turn but food is amazing, one of the best food i have had in Mathura and Vrindvan is at this place.

Timings of yatra - There are no specific timings, you can do this yatra anytime  of the year any time of the day - means 24 hours a day yatra is open .. people prefer to do yatra during night in summers, as day time it is hot outisde.

Guide along me in this tour: Ashu ji has helped us in tour of Mathura and Vrindavan, he was there with us all through out this journey, he is a professinal Tour guide. He charges Rs 1500 for 8 hours then Rs 300 per hour extra.

Summary of South Odisha: This area is completely different from East Odisha, this place is all about landscape, scenic views, low density population, there are no tall buildings, people live simple life and are close to nature. This place is largely known for Tribal population.

Following are the details of places we visited as part of this journey, i am sure you will love to watch this episode, as we explored hills, waterfalls, street food, and so much in this journey.

Chatikona: Every wednesday there is a tribal market at this place, many foreigners travel to Rayagada to see Odisha tribe. If you meet a tribe at Chatikona, you should not be surprised if they ask for Rs 100 for a selfie. Earlier they were not like that but over the years, they have been offered money for a picture with a Tribe.

All said, there ornaments are worth watching, it is really interesting to learn about their life, especially how do they manage their living plus so many other things. 

For all this you need to have a guide along, other wise it will not do justice to the visit.

Last but not least - food of South Odisha , especially Korpat has no similarity with food of East Odisha ie Bhubaneswar orPuri…..

Start early: Try starting from Bhubaneswar at 6 am, so you can spend quality time at Pipili and Bhubaneswar. We missed scenic views on the road that connects konark to Puri, if you leave Konark by 4 pm, you will love to see the coastal areas and scenic views.

For better experience at konark sun temple - you should look at hiring a ASI registered guide.

We missed to visit ASI museum, ensure that you don’t miss it, which means you should reach there on time.

Light and sound show is closed on monday, so plan your journey accordingly.

Last but not the least, we have travelled in Odisha for 19 days, so if you follow our series you will get good knowledge on how you should plan your Odisha tour.  This is Episode 3 of our Odisha tour, just in case if you have missed previous episodes or any other episode you can check out the playlist, otherwise you will miss continuity.

Amritsar is the food capital of Punjab, i enjoyed Punjabi food in famous food joints which were referred to me by locals.

Few observations about Amritsar Dhabas & restaurants:

Most restaurants use Desi ghee in food preparation, quantity of ghee or butter is generally higher, if you want dish with less ghee, then you should tell it at the time of giving order.

Most restaurants serve dish with yellow Amul butter, if you want white butter, tell that specifically at the time of giving order.

Food may look heavy on stomach but water of Amritsar helps in quick digestion.

Manek chowk in Ahmedabad is a jewellery market that turns into night food bazar after 8 pm and this street food continues to be there till 2 am.

It's hard to avoid eating street food at Manek Chowk, There is so much of crowd there in weekends that you may not get chair to sit but yes if you want to avoid crowd go there on week day and that too at 8 pm. Foodies start going there after 9 pm or 10 pm.

Following are some of the food joints visited by me during this journey of Manek chowk.

1. Azad sev wala: I was truly impressed by the quality of sev at this shop. Price mentioned in the video.

2. Kandoi Bhogilal Mulchand: Very popular sweet shop in Ahmedabad, this brand has multiple shops but this one is the oldest.

3. Mahalaxmi pav bhaji: You can't miss this shop at Manek chowk: Nice texture and good taste of pav bhaji. I was more impressed by the pav served with the bhaji.

4.  Shri kailash Pav bhaji and pulao: I enjoyed Tawa pulao at this shop, while they were serving Pav Bhaji as well.

5. Asharfilal kulfi: Nice taste, they have chain of outlets in Ahmedabad. I enjoyed Chiku kulfi in its traditional avatar.

6. Balan Dosa: Very famous, i found it hard to decide which one to go for out of 50 Dosa. USP is - cooking through traditional method. Side served Masala was very nice but i did not enjoy sambar and chutney at this shop.

7. Bombay Gulalwadi: I ordered manchurian at this stall, i guess this could have been better but that's ok.

8. Manek sandwich: This was a great innovation on sandwich, i was  surprised to see ice cream in a sandwich, together with jam and pineapple. This was superb taste.

Should you have any experiences on food of Manek chowk, please write back, i will wait for your comments.

Initially we were looking at making a short 2 minute video and doing an integration of the same in one of the videos of Mangalore but when i reached there i realised that this is a long process, so covering it in 2 minutes will not carry any meaning for us or for viewers.

cashew factory contact numbers
Mangla cashew: 91-824-2481177 ,  2481785 ,  2481802

so we decided to making a dedicated video on this subject. This video on cashew processing has all the necessary details and information that can help anyone learn about how cashew is processed from nut to kernel.

Hope you will enjoy watching this episode and this has loads of information and knowledge.

We started our journey from Mangalore,  formally - Mangaluru. We have used drone shots for the first time in our tour, i am sure you wil notice and like the footages.

This particular episode was shot on 23rd Nov 2020.

Following are the details of the places visit by us as part of this journey, if you have any query, pl feel free to write that in comments section.

Panambur Beach - Best time to visit this beach is evening only, when you want to see the sunset, it is a located at at distance of 14 kms from Mangalore - directionally on way to Udupi.

Taj Mahal cafe - This cafe opens at 6 am, many locals visit this place for early morning breakfast. This is an awesome place to have breakfast at Mangalore.

Buns - 30 per pcs - Buns with Thove - Rs 50
Poori bhaji - 80 - 2pcs
Biscuit roti - 30
Wheat & banana halwa -1 pc-  25
Teek roti - 30… 2 pc with bhaji - ( 30+30+20)
Filter Coffee - 25
Holige - 20

Sultan Bateri & TannirBavi - Best thing to do is to reach either Sultan Bateri watch tower or TannirBavi beach by road and after visiting that location go to the other one by ferry, it just takes 5 to 7 minutes to cross the river on ferry. This means Sultan Bateri watch tower built by Tipu Sultan is on one side of the river  and TannirBavi beach is on the other side of the river.

Ferry ticket cost is Rs 10 per person,  hope i remember correctly.

Giri Manjas lunch - This is a famous sea food joint, This place is bit tight on sitting space, earlier this was a house and later they converted it into an eatery and it has really become a famous seafood joint because of the simplicity of food and its taste.

I had this in lunch at Giri Manjas - i could not understand what is it, editing the description about this - Avarekalu = Hyasinth beans or Lilva beans or Field beans - Surti papdi.. 

They are open only for lunch, there is no dinner here.

If you want to visit this place, you should visit during off peak hours may be early lunch at 12 noon or late lunch at 3 or 3.15 pm that’s the only way you can save from the crowd rush.

Food is excellent at this place, but i think they need to have a new setup near by which is more airy, may be air conditioned too bcoz weather of Mangalore is hot.

Anjal - 210
Bangude - @ rs 100
Prawns fry - 210
Meal - rs 50

Phalguni cashew centre - This shop is famous fo retail of cashews. They have cashews ranging from Rs 600 a kg to Rs 2200 a kg.
Hotel roopa building
Balmatta road, Mangaluru
7406900021

Pabbas - I labelled this as world’s best ice cream because its so hard to imagine a ice cream better than this, at least i can’t think of one. 

All their innovations are master tastes, so if you happen to travel to Mangalore you should not miss Pabbas ice cream. Out of all innovations the most famous is Gadbad, as this is their oldest most popular one.

Gadbad - 115
Special Gadbad - 145
Tiramisu - 135
Tropical dhamaka - 120
Marzi paan - 160
I-Pizza vanilla - 399

My hotel at Mangalore - Hotel - metro plaza - attavar road, near Mangalore central railway station , Hampankatta.

I booked this hotel through Fab hotels, they are budget hotel chain, https://www.fabhotels.com/

Taxi for this tour - i don't have the number of the driver but can share number of agency - Blany Taxi Mangalore - 99004475615
I paid tariff of Rs 1400 per day and got a nice accommodation, may be bcoz of covid  - less people stay in hotel so they are offering some discounts.

Over all Mangalore tour and Coastal karnataka tour has been awesome for us, hope you enjoyed watching this episode.

This is the first time we went to Yamunotri Dham, everything about this yatra is like memory of lifetime.

I am sure you will notice lot of it in the video. I have also share important information with regard to Yamuntori Dham.

For your quick reference i am sharing the summary of this information below.

Motor vehicle can go upto Janki Chatti.

You need to trek from Janki chatti to Yamuntori Dham - 5 km distance.

We did this journey walking up and down. it took us about 3 hours - going to Yamunotri Dham  and about one and a half hour coming back.

Journey is very steep, if you are used to such trek you can easily walk down or else you may decide to take pony or Palki or Pithu- this is a open basket in which you will sit and that person will hold it on his back.


Rates: No fixed rates- its all about demand and supply.

May to mid june is the peak time: Palki can cost about 8 to 10k.
Pony can cost : Rs 3k.
Basket- About 4k.

If you undertake journey after this peak time, costs will go down by 20 to 30 percent.

Best time to travel: 15th August to 30th September.
Try to avoid May till 15th June period because there is lot of traffic jam during this period.

Yamunotri Dham opening and closing dates:

Opening: Akshaya Tritiya: like this year 2019 it was on 7th May.
Closing date: Bhai Dooj after Deepawali.

You may still check it out before you plan your travel because opening and closing dates are sometimes also dependent upon weather conditions.


If you want to stay back at Yamunotri Dham, there are many Ashram's out over there, but don't expect modern facilities, as these are mostly Ashrams.

Just in case if you missed watching Episode 2 of Char Dham Yatra, Do have a look at it because we spoke about Mode of travelling in that episode.

I think i have spoken about every needed information in this episode, still just in case if you feel something has got missed , Do let me know.

We traveled to Lachung and then to Zero point. It was so beautiful to see zero point, Height of 15700 feet..

This is the best place to visit in Sikkim. If you travel to Sikkim you should not miss Zero point, Lachen & Lachung.

We travelled from Lachen to Lachung then from Lachung to Yumthang valley as part of this travel episode.

In the whole of sikkim series you will notice North East India food and North East India tourism places.

This episode is about North Sikkim Tourist places and traditional food of North Sikkim.

Day 5 

RC Homestay Lachen, Sikkim - 737120
Food & Lodging - ₹1800  Per Person. They give rooms on rent to families not to individual travellers.

If someone wants to go  Gurudongmar Lake, then people take halt at Lachen and then go to the lake…

I mentioned about Gurudongmar lake in EP 4...
Google Map Location - https://goo.gl/XQj2F4 

2. Yumthang - There are 12 to 15 Shops where you can get Woolens, Jackets, Shoes at a very Reasonable Price. I got the Jacket and a pair of shoes for myself ₹100 each. If you are going Further to Zero Point, you will need them, as it is quite Cold. I went there in June. 

You will not find any traditional food in yumthang, Maggie and Tea is the only option. 

3. Zero Point Yumthang Valley - Travelling to Zero Point, one should start very early Morning, like I did. You  should aim to reach Zero point by max 10 am…

Since its high altitude 15700 feet...oxygen is low, so be careful , you may carry some medicine as well if needed..Weather is cold carry woolens as well..

4. Summit Alpine Resort, Lachung: This is a good resort in Lachung, we stayed here plus had out dinner here…

Dinner that we had in the Restaurant, some of the Vegetables were provided by us, They had charged us for the cooking charges including the food that was ordered fresh from them...  ₹750 for Food.

Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick: I did a mistake by not visiting this shop again, i wanted to get some parcel done for taking along sweets for my home but eventually bought sandesh for my home from Airport by paying higher price,that was obvious.

I am not exaggerating by saying that if you have Jal Bhara sandesh in Kolkata you will become big fan of this sweet, Not only that but more sweets as well.

Hope you enjoyed watching this Episode 2 of our Kolkata, West Bengal food and travel series.

I am deeply impressed by the West Bengal food cuisine, It will not be wrong to say that Kolkata food is underrated… There is so much more that we missed, there wasa 2 day strike in Kolkata when we were there.

We missed those 2 working days, but yes we did our best on available time.

My sincere thanks to all the subscribers of visa2explore who met me there at Kolkata and guided me on tour planning… thanks a lot for your guidance.

Bhimkund  -  It is a natural  water source, which is considered to be holy. It has connections with Mahabharat times. It is also known as neelkund, located 80 km from Chhatarpur in Madhya Pradesh. 

We were interested to visit Shri Jatashankar Dham which is around 30 km from bhimkund, but due to paucity of time, we could not visit.

Hotel Apple Pie - We paid Rs 2800 double occupancy  https://bit.ly/3CahGjP. While on our journey we explore one more option in Rakcham, you can stay @ Rupin river view - Rs 2500 double occupancy. 
 
Walking distance from Apple pie - Water steam Rakcham, beautiful location

Proceed to Chitkul - We came across 2 water steams on our way, a Beautiful view & location. 

Chitkul  (Altitude - 11320 ft)- way to chitkul road condition is quite good, had heard from lot of people the road condition is not good, I found it to be good, It is not necessary, you don’t have to have Suv type car to reach chitkul, you can even reach in swift dezire too at a slower speed. 

Chitkul Dhaba - Can get some tea & rajma chawal - Rs 100 per person, whatever you want to eat, you can eat. View from Dhaba - Majestic view of Baspa river

After dhaba we went to see a closer view of the Baspa river. Even on 24th, we could feel the cold wind, you can’t stand without woollen wear. During wintertime, it would be way colder. The view is unforgettable,  You can get the pictures clicked near the baspa river. I noticed there were camps, which charge around - Rs 1500 per camp double occupancy. Below are the details of one of the camp at chitkul.
Yog’s bro’s Camp & Adventure  - 9459440889  / 8988201936 
Address - VPO CHITKUL, TEHSIL SANGLA, DIST. KINNAUR

 In Rakcham, you will find a network of all prime mobile operators. After the river view, we went to the Rupin River view for Lunch, whom we checked the hotel rates. We enjoyed the Traditional lunch by looking at the view.

Hotel where we had our lunch Rupin river view - you can check out their rooms on below link:
https://www.shopper.com/p/GuCo/r

After lunch at Rakcham, we proceeded towards Sangla, It is a bigger market as compare to nearby places Rakcham or Chitkul, If you want to buy any daily need products, you will easily get at Sangla. Umbrella, General Groceries, Winter clothes, chemist shops, can find doctor’s clinic too.

While travelling I realised that one can easily spend 3 to 4 days in Sangla. It is way more than beautiful than I expected.

 Kamru Fort - After 1 km from Sangla market, we reached the parking of Kamru fort, from there we did 20 min trek to the fort, 5 min before reaching Kamru fort, We noticed Badri Vishal Temple with lord buddha idol, someone told us, palanquin of Lord Badri Vishal has gone to the village. We proceed further to the fort.  It is 7 storey fort, not a bigger fort, it is ancient. You can visit from outside, entry to the fort is prohibited. Just outside, you will see a temple dedicated to Goddess Kamakhya, the main temple in Guwahati, which is one of shaktipeeth 51.

When we were returning downhill from the fort, we noticed the palanquin of Lord Badri Vishal has returned, after paying obeisance.

 We proceed to Kalpa (Karcham to Kalpa - 33 km)  (Sangla to Karcham - 18 km) (just before 10 km Kalpa Reckong Peo)

We stayed here at Hotel Kinner villa in Kalpa. This is a nice property, we got a double occupancy room at Rs 2000 plus taxes. So whenever we stay tariff it means without breakfast. We also saw the full moon on 24th June, view was mesmerizing, if you are visiting during full moon to kalpa, should not miss this view. If the sky is clear then only you can see this view.

Information about the next episode ( EP - 4): you will see the journey from Local sightseeing in Kalpa.

We started our tour by visiting Paonta Sahib Gurdwara then proceeded towards Renuka ji. We were lucky that we got accomodation to stay at Himachal Pradesh Tourism Guest house at Renuka ji.

Explore our merchandise:
https://kadakmerch.com/collections/visa2explore

24th sept was the date when we reached Renuka ji - Day 1 of our journey, that time Himachal tourism was giving 40 percent discount on hotel room tariffs.

Next day ie on 25th sept - we started from Renuka ji by visiting the lake and temple and went to Barog.

While visiting Barog i had 3 things or activities in mind.

Pathi ji - we met at Shri Ponta Sahib Gurdwara - Sh. Gurmeet Singh ji - 9736732013

A. Chachu da Dhaba - Famous for paratha, this is a popular shop in the Barog market.

B. Barog raiilway station : This narrow gauge railway station in between kalka and Chandigarh has a exit to the the longest tunnel of this route, so i wanted to see the railway station. 
During our travel, railway service was not working, if you want to stay at a guest house in Barog railway station you can do your online booking from irctc website.

Approach road to the station is steep, its difficult reach here with luggage as you will need to walk half a km down from the main road, plus going back up if you are coming by road and planning to stay here in the night. So if you are planning to stay here overnight then you should reach Barog railway station by train only, this narrow gauge train runs between kalka and shimla.

C. Third thing i had in mind when visiting Barog was to see Barog heights hotel, i had got this reference from many people that this hotel is at height, many people travle here , live here for 2-3 days enjoy weather and beauty, so i wanted to see this place for myself. 

Though room tariffs are slightly on higher side but the view is worth it.

In the night we reached Kasauli, this is a little less explored hill station, though not as popular as Manali or Shimla but the place has its own village like charm.

I realised that room tariffs of hotels and guest houses in Kasauli is slightly on higher side, plus availability of accommodation during weekends is a concern, so you should travel only with pre booking.
You should get your pre booking done at Kasauli if you are planning to stay at Kasauli.

We stayed at Kasauli residency home stay, this place is on the outskirts of Kasauli about 3 km from the market. Nice place, good staff, only small thing maintenance  is needed, but that's ok..

In the next episode you will see activities we did in Kasauli then we went to Mandi, next episode is going to be more interesting as you will see this journey from Kasauli to Mandi and then to Parashar lake.

hope you enjoyed watching this episode.

This is the third time we are travelling to Himachal Pradesh, we have travelled to Manali and Shimla before and there are videos of the same on our YouTube channel.

When you are Visiting Jaisalmer - Sam Desert, it is advisable to get a Pre-Booking done for your Stay from any of the Websites or through any other Resource, As when you reach the Sam Desert you will not get a chance to negotiate.

We had a great time at Jaisalmer, though it is a great experience to stay in sam over night. But if you want to control cost then a better idea is to stay at town and then travel 40 km distance to Sam.. go there in the evening time, enjoy camel ride and cultural activity. Usually this costs about Rs 1000 per person including dinner.

But all this is season dependent too. So you will have to check the details.

Taxi to and from from Jaisalmer town will cost you Rs 1000.

Just in case if you have any query, please feel free to write back, i would love to hear back from you in this regard.

Following are the details of places we visited as part of our journey in the hilly region of North Kerala.

 Kurumbalakotta - Sunrise View Point: On the day we visited, sky was not clear, so we could not see sun rise. Plus we could not shoot properly in the dark, so video has not come clear.

This is an awesome place to go for sun rise. You need to trek for about 1 km before you reach the sunrise spot.

Address - Kerala 673122 
Google Map Location - https://goo.gl/2qpYuR 

AJ Hotel: This is about 3 km from the above sunrise point. We forgot where we parked our vehicle, reached this spot through someone’s help. It is a road side food joint. 

Kadala Curry with Poori Rs. 36
Address: cheriamkolli, wayanad, kerala
Google Map Location - https://goo.gl/TGhBeP 

Seethadevi Lava Kusa Temple, Pulpally, Kerala: You may want to read more about this temple through this link.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seetha_Devi_Temple

Time: 5 to 12: 30 noon & 5:30 to 7:30 pm
Google Map Location - https://goo.gl/WEyFFQ 

Food Fest - Kalpetta: By chance we noticed that there was food festival going on at this place for 3 days. We stopped there and explored the Malabar cuisine.

Address: This was on main road of Kalpetta market but this would no good as the food festival was there only for 3 days.


Edakkal Caves: This place is so beautiful, Huge size caves, ideally should be called Edakka - as this means stone in between. If you are in Wayanad, you must visit this place.

Address - Nenmeni, Kerala 673595 
Google Map Location - https://goo.gl/Ux8gh6 

Edakkal Hermitage Resort: This resort was near the caves only, we had great time here, 1st time in my life- i had some food at a cave that was a natural formation.

Cave Dining for couple Rs. 2999 
Address: edakkal caves, wayanad, kerala
Website: www.edakkalhermitage.com 

Google Map Location  - https://goo.gl/hyGQXk 

Vistara Resort : we stayed at this hotel. 
Tariff Rs 5500, This is little far from the main road, room was facing dam, it was great experience to stay there overnight.

Plantain Vada Rs. 250
Bamboo Rice Payasam  Rs. 150
Address: karapuzha, wayanad, kerala
Google Map Location - https://goo.gl/tyZSPz 

If you are looking at travelling to Kerala, then including Wayanad as your travel destination is a great idea. Only thing that if wish to travel to Central and South Kerala as well then you may face difficulty reaching those locations by road - because of huge distance between North and South Kerala.

I would try and make a summary video on Kerala tour, may be that can be of help for some people who want to learn about the whole trip in summary format.

Do let me know how did you find this episode. I would look forward to hear back from you in this regards.

You may plan lunch or dinner at any of those restaurant. We visited 2 restaurant in China Town and had chinese food there.

This place is part of Kolkata only, so you don’t have to go far, half an hour drive from Indian museum.

Few years back there were tanneries in this area but now those units have been force shut by government, First appearance of China town looks shabby, like not well maintained or not clean but restaurants have done their bit on hygiene.

Usually people make it to Janki Chatti on day 1 and next day they go to Yamunotri Dham, since we were invited for Garhwali marriage at a village, we are doing this journey on day 2.

We lost more than 4 hours on this day because we got stuck in traffic jam, lesson we learn was that one should start early and end the journey early, means reach the destination by 4 pm.

Following are the details of the places visited by us during this tour.

Himrol Village: We stayed at a home stay at this village. This is about 30 km out of Yamunotri Dham route.
Following are the details of the food we had in breakfast.

Multigrain Roti (Combination of Wheat, Mandua, Red Rice & Ram Dana)
Pahadi Rajma
Aloo Mushroom (Made From Dry Mushroom) 
Honey
Apple Chutney
Herbal Tea

Room Tariff: 1000 per person including Breakfast and Dinner
Bharat Rana: 9639827574
Address: Himrol Village, Uttarakhand, 249171

Location: https://tinyurl.com/yyt6l7qv 

Barnigad: This is the diversion point from where one road goes to Yamunotri Dham and other one goes to Himrol village, this is a beautiful location. One should have a look at scenic beauty from this point.

Location: https://tinyurl.com/y4k4l28u 

Lakha Mandal: Hilstory of this place is linked to Pandavas of Mahabharat, locals told me that they are told by their ancesstors that Pandavas have visited Lakha Mandal 3 times during their life time and this place was built by them.

Location: https://tinyurl.com/y5k7k3nb 


Janki Chatti: This is the base point for Yamunotri Dham yatra.
Yamunotri Dham is 5 km from Janki chatti. You can take a pony ride or decide to walk down , though its uphill, you will need good stamina to do so.

Location: https://tinyurl.com/yybxgz74 

Important note with regard to mode of travelling and travel cost.

Drivers usually charge extra money for going to places like Mana village or Panch kedar or Panch Badri but for us it was all part of 4500 per day deal.

Best time to travel for char Dham yatra is mid august to september end. We did this journey from 13th May 2019 to 10th June 2019- this is not the best time, May means a lot of traffic jam. Mid June to 15th Aug is monsoon time - avoid hills.

Cost Details:
Innova Per day hire cost: Rs 4500.
One day stay at Himrol village Rs 1000 per person
We had meal in between but that’s not shown in the video because i found nothing special worth doing a video record.
At min cost basis it works out to Rs 6000 for Day 1. 

Overall Tour cost approx indicators:

Innova per day cost: Rs 4500.
Average per day meal cost per person: 800.
Average room tariff: Rs 1700 to Rs 2200. Generally on this route single person accommodation is not available, so solo travellers end up paying more.
Average parking cost per day: Rs 100 ( at Char Dham destinations).

We did this tour with Gangotri Travels: 

Good thing we noticed: Driver was disciplined, like ready for travel at 5 am, Guiding us on how to plan the journey, which is definitely a plus for a traveller, plus maintaining vehicle - neat and clean.

Thing that agency needs to improve: At a point during the journey i wanted to speak to them  on a particular issue and realised that they are too busy to take customer calls  but for this event rest of the things were fine with  clean transactions.

Above costs are for the month of May till 15th June. Thereafter all costs generally drop by 20 to 30 percent.

Our cost was way too high,  there is so much in miscellaneous cost that occurs in any trip. Any ways above figures are indicators only.
Hope you enjoyed watching this first episode of Char Dham Yatra.

Some information regarding travel to Uttarakhand:

You need to get your covid test done within 72 hours of your travel. This means you should have a covid negative report and test must have been conducted by a ICMR approved Lab.

The test which you need to get done is RTPCR.

Post this you need to apply for E pass, you will be asked to attach covide negative report and aadhar card when applying for E pass ( there are option options in place of aadhar card), check out the website link below:

http://smartcitydehradun.uk.gov.in/pravasi-registration#

On 25th August ie Day 1 of our journey our E pass and Covid negative report was checked 4 times- first check was done near Haldwani then after that it detailed checking was done at Golapar stadium also called as Indira Gandhi international stadium, Between Haldwani and Bhimtal we were also stopped at 2 checkposts, where we had to show our documents.

All hotels and resorts where we stayed asked us to produce Covid negative report, as they have to submit it on a daily basis to the police.

If you reach Uttarakhand without a covid negative report then you will have to go for a 7 day quarantine at government centers. 

Once you show your valid documents and reach Nainital or Bhimtal then you can travel anywhere in Uttarakhand, with change in district you will have to show the documents again for which police check posts in the district will guide you. 

Like when we reached Kausani, we were guided by police to go to a near by center to get our temperature check done.

Following are the details of the places visited by us as part of this tour, ie Episode 1.

Country Inn Bhimtal : Though tariff at this resort starts from rs 5000 , service of staff was good but resort upkeep is an issue, which is noticed.

Other than room tariff of Rs 4500, we paid Rs 1705 ( this included dinner for two and breakfast for two plus morning tea for two). 

Room that you saw in the video is an upgraded one, since there were few tourists, occupancy was low, so they upgraded us to a bigger room.

Key information with regard to this journey:

Hotel Vatika - Nice hotel located at a distance of half a km  before Chamunda Devi temple, good service and owner involvement in the hotel is high. You can connect with them on 8728010808
Chamunda Devi temple - You should keep 2 hours for this, as there is always crowd, we went there at a time when there was no rush, avoid weekends.
Norbulingka institute - its a good idea to stay there, you need to book online, you can do overnight stay there, have their food as well.
Dharamshala - This place is commercial hub, Government offices are located here, so if you are travelling to this region, i will suggest you to stay either at Mcleodganj or Dharamkot or Naddi and avoid staying at Dharamshalla.

We stayed at Himachal tourism guest house by the name club house - nice property - it has parking place available. I checked with few locals to find out about parking space at hotels in Mcleodganj i was told that it is now available in most hotels earlier that was an issue.
Dharamkot - calm place, good to stay here, but i will prefer Naddi over Dharamkot as this 2 km journey between Mc.leodganj to Naddi is narrow road, you face traffic jam etc.
We at our late afternoon lunch at Norling restaurant - famous local joint for Tibbetan food.

Should you have any query with regard to this journey, please feel free to write back to me.

Following are the details of the journey done by us which are part of this day.

This video was shot on 24th August 2022,

Chittorgarh Fort -  It was the capital of Mewar and is located in the present-day city of Chittorgarh. It is believed that this fort  was constructed by Chitrangad Mori of the Maurya dynasty way back in the 7th century A.D.

In 1303, the Delhi Sultanate ruler Alauddin Khalji led an army to conquer Chittorgarh, which was ruled by the king Rana Ratan Singh.

It is generally believed that it commemorates Padmini's jauhar and more than 16k ladies who lived in the fort did this Jauhar. This festival is held primarily to commemorate the bravery of Rajput ancestors and all three jauhars which happened at Fort.

Kumbha Mahal - is located near the Vijay Stambha close to the entrance gate. 
According to the legends, the founder of the city of Udaipur, Maharana Udai Singh was born here, and his life was saved by his wet nurse Panna Dhai, who sacrificed her own son and successfully managed to take a young Udai Singh to a safe destination. This place was once the home of the famous bhakti poetess Meerabai.
Ticket: Rs 40 per person for the fort entry.

Kumbhaswamin Temple - was built by Rana Kumbha in 1448 AD. The temple is dedicated to Varaha, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Here you will see Meerabai temple inside. She spent long hours here in dedication to Lord Vishnu. 

Vijay Stambh - The tower was constructed by the Rajput king Rana Kumbha of Mewar in 1448 to commemorate his victory over the army of Malwa led by Mahmud Khalji in the Battle of Sarangpur.

Kalika Temple - It was originally a Sun temple which was partly destroyed in the sack of Chittor, it was rebuilt during the time of Rana Kumbha. Built originally in the 8th century, this temple was dedicated to the worship of the sun god before it was converted into a shrine for Kalika, in the 14th century.

Padmini Palace - Here Rani Padmini lived after she married Rawal Ratan Singh, the ruler of Mewar Kingdom who ruled between 1302 and 1303 CE. 

After the victory of Alauddin, It was assigned to his young son Khizr Khan (or Khidr Khan), and the Chittorgarh fort was renamed ""Khizrabad"".

Kirti Stambh - known as the Tower of Fame is a 12th century tower situated inside the Chittorgarh Fort Complex. The main purpose behind its commission was to glorify Jainism. Tower was built by a Jain merchant Jeeja Bhagerwala during the reign of Rawal Kumar Singh in c. 1179–1191 CE.

Ratan Singh Palace - is a monument of immense historical importance located in the premises of the ravishing Chittorgarh Fort. he beauty of this palace is enhanced ten fold by the Ratneshwar Lake which is located next to the palace.

Light And Sound Show - Here you can see the history of the Chittor Fort in light & sound persenation. 
Ticket: Rs 177 per person

We stayed at the Panna hotel which is located at 8 km distance from the fort, stay was ok, neither too good nor bad, This hotel needs renovation, but the property location was good, they have a huge park outside the building.

Hope you enjoyed watching this episode on our journey from Mana village to Gurudwara Gobind Ghat.

Though we mentioned in the video that next day we will go to Gurudwara Shri Hemkunt Sahib but we could not go there next day. 
Reason- we were there on 1st June and that was the day of opening, there were many yatri’s there plus there was risk of glacier melting as well.. 

Gurudwara management requested Yatri’s to stay back for one or two days and then go there…

We decided to go to Auli and then come back.. You will see Yatra of Shri Hemkunt sahib in episodes to come.

For your information: Yatra for Shri Hemkunt Sahib starts from Guduwara Gobind Ghat, you can go there on your vehcile then from there you have to travel 13 km.. out of which 4 km you can go on shared jeep then from there 9 km trek to Gurdwara Gobind Dham.

You should look at staying at Gurudwara Gobind Dham or at some near by hotel at Gobind Dham next day you have to trek 6 km to go to Shri Hemkunt Sahib then come back to Gobind Dham. Since oxygen level at Shri Hemkunt Sahib is low, so people are not allowed to stay back there.

For more detailed information about yatra of Shri Hemkunt Sahib, pl. See the episode of the same.

Thanks a lot

In between we met a landslide while traveling to Chandanwadi. There we changed our vehicle and continued our journey.

About this journey:

We started our day from Grand view hotel Dalhousie - We did our night stay at this hotel, located just next to Dalhousie bus stand, this is a nice property, good food, owner involvement in the business is high, that makes the guests feel more comfortable.

we visited local market and Panchpulla watefalls, this is within 3 -4 km distance from Dalhousie bus stand, you may skip these attractions as there is nothing much to see.

Dalhousie is all about scenic views that you can get from your hotel, you can club your Dalhousie tour with Chamba, Khajjiar and Bharmour.

We started from Dalhousie at around 2 pm to go to Chamba, on our route we halted at Mama da Dhaba, this is a small eatery where they serve Chambyali Dham, food is simple and very good, I really enjoyed the taste.

After food we left for Bharmour, on our route we enjoyed view of Ravi river.

Road from chamba to Bharmour was not good, half of it was good and half distance was not good.

We did our night stay at Gaurikund guest house - Bharmour. 

In the next episode you will see our Bharmour tour and will also see the journey form Bharmour to Chamba.

This is a comprehensive video, containing the much needed information about Uttarakhand Char Dham yatra.

This video will help you plan Uttarakhand tour, Garhwal tour and char Dham Yatra.

Following are the details about Uttarakhand Tour:

We started our yatra from Yamunotri Dham, then went to Gangotri Dham, followed by Kedarnath Dham, Badrinath Dham and finally visited Shri Hemkunt Sahib and returned back to Haridwar.

During this yatra we also visited Panch kedar and some of the temples of Panch Badri.

There were many other places , like Mussoorie, Chopta, Auli, Budha Kedar and many other places.

If you want to learn about this yatra route and plan your own journey, i will suggest you to watch our series in order, that way you will not lose on continuity.

Biometric registration: Before starting your Dham yatra, you need to get the biometric registration. During the complete yatra route, no one checked our registration. Thinking loud on need of biometric registration.

My take on this is: If there is a natural disaster on the yatra route, you know it has happened in the past, Government will have details of people who were there on the yatra route during that time.

Though this information may not be accurate but atleast serves as an indicator.",755879,13720,713

During this journey of Shimla district, especially places in and around Shimla i realised that Kufri and Fagu deserve greater time.

If you want to stay away from hustle and bustle of Shimla than fagu is a good option.

I noticed that Fagu valley has beautiful scenic view infact better than what you experience from Kufri.

I noticed that there are adventure activities in Kufri, most important of all - Horse ride is a must do activity in Kufri.

I also got chance to explore local food of Himachal pradesh.  Details of food i had in this food journey is given below for your ready reference.

Day 5

Extreme Adventure: They have couple of adventure activities here at Kufri this place. Apart from this there are 4-5 more spots in Kufri where travellers can do adventure sports largely catered for children.

It will be great to see your experiences about Himachal Pradesh food and places to visit in comments below. 

Key information that you should know in advance if you undertake trip to shimla:

Time to avoid: 15th May to 15th July - very high traffic.

Snow fall time in Shimla: 25th Dec to 31st jan - it does snow 2-3 times. But if you want more snow or want to do skiing - go to Narkanda. 

This video you just saw is about Narkanda.
How to travel: By air, train, cab, your car.: My suggestion don’t take your car if you plan to go to only shimla, its hard to find parking space in shimla, unless you are sure that your hotel provides parking space.

Himachali food: Yes its good but to enjoy the food, you should have taste for pure ghee, in most food Ghee is served as side serving.

Since i spent 8 full days in Shimla, i have developed decent knowledge about this place, should you have any query, please feel free to ask in comments below. I will look forward to hear back on this from you

Thanks for your time.

182,UCFuxLOUo41P3eEAW8U-Dwjg,De3b6y3btkk,2022-12-11T03:30:06Z,"EP 1 Gwalior Fort History | Data Bandi Chhod Gurudwara Gwalior, Tansen ka Maqbara | Madhya Pradesh","Gwalior fort is one of the oldest forts of India, This is one of the main tourist attractions of Gwalior in particular and Madhya pradesh in particular.

In this episode you will see full details of Gwalior fort and nearby tourist attractions ( largely temples and Gurudwara) which have historical importance.

This Video was shot on 27 oct 2022.

Below are the activities we did on this day.

Gwalior Fort: It is known for its stunning architecture and unique history. One of the most unique things about this monument is that it has influences from Hindu and Islamic architecture alike. 

According to a local legend, the fort was built by a local king named Suraj Sen in 6 CE. Maan Singh was the last Tomar ruler, and he constructed several monuments inside the fort complex.

Pawan Guide - Gwalior fort - 9131705755

Suraj Kund: It is a beautiful pond situated near the Gwalior Fort. According to the story the king suffered from leprosy, he met a sadhu named Gwalipa near the fort. The monk asked the king to drink some water from the pond, Raja drank the water and got cured of leprosy. Then the king named the city Gwalipa after the monk, and from then, the city came to be called Gwalior and the Suraj Kund is named after the king.

Teli Ka Mandir: It is a Hindu temple located within the Gwalior Fort. It is Dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu and Matrikas.The temple shows signs of extensive damage and change. It was badly damaged in the plunder raids by Muslim army of Qutb-ud-din Aibak and his successor Iltutmish in 1232 CE along with other temples in the fort. 
It is said that this temple was built by oil merchant caste rather than kings.

Saas Bahu Temple: Originally it is Sahasra-Bahu temple which means ""One with thousand arms"", a form of Vishnu. This temple was built in 1092 by King Mahipala of the Kachchhapaghata dynasty. 

Gurudwara Data Bandi Chor:  The history of this is associated with the imprisonment of Guru Har Gobind Sahib in Gwalior Fort and release in which he managed to win the freedom of 52 Rajas (Kings) who had long suffered imprisonment in the Fort. The word ""Bandi"" means ""imprisoned"", ""Chhod"" means ""release"" that is why it is called Gurudwara Data Bandi Chor.

Chaturbhuj Temple: It is a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Vishnu. One of the temple's inscriptions contains the earliest known inscription of symbol ""O"" to represent zero in India, the earliest existent use of zero. But the temple is partially damaged including the Lord Vishnu Statue, its tower has been restored, and most of the interior artwork is missing.

Gujari Mahal: It is an Archeological Museum also called Gwalior Fort Museum. Legends say that the palace was built by Man Singh Tomar for his wife Mrignayani who belonged to the Gujjar tribe. The 9th wife of Man Singh Tomar. She demanded a separate palace for herself with a regular water supply through an aqueduct from the nearby Rai River. Now the palace has been converted into an archaeological museum.

Tansen Maqbara: One of the greatest musicians of India. After his death he was buried in the mausoleum complex of his Sufi master Shaikh Muhammad Ghaus in Gwalior. Mohammed Ghaus's monumental tomb was built by Akbar. This monument is a massive sandstone structure with rising towers on the four corners, crowned by cupolas and a huge central dome.

Siddis in India - There are two places in India where Siddis are settled in large number 

A. Yellapur - About 50k population

Following are the details of places visited by  us during this journey that started from 

Palampur and ended at Shri Chamunda Devi temple

Rupayan homestay: We had breakfast at this homestay, it was a very comfortable stay, charge for night stay here is Rs 1500, staff hospitality is exceptionally good.

Palampur cooperative tea factory - This tea factory is at a distance of 2 km from palampur, you can visit the factory and can also buy Kangra tea from the store outside the factory.

I bought 2 types of tea for myself, details in the video.

Jakhni mata mandir - This is located at a distance of 10 km from palampur, scenic views from the temple are really good, this temple is located at a height, you will love to visit this place for the temple and the scenic views.

Saini dhaba - this is a vaishno dhab in Palampur - they serve decent food, we went to this place with intention to have Kangri Dham but had there the normal North Indian food as they don’t serve Kangri Dham.

Neugal Khad - This river side sightseeing spot of Palampur is located at a distance of about 6 km from Palampur market. If you happen to stay at Palmapur, then i will suggest you to spend some time at this location, you will have great time there.

Gopalpur Zoo - This zoo is located at a distance of 8 km from Neugal Khad, you may want to visit this zoo, if kids are coming along, as they will enjoy watching animals. When we visited this place, zoo was closed because of corona.

Dorzong monastery - This is located at a distance of 4 km from Gopalpur zoo, You will see a temple there and a institute where they teach Buddhism.

Gurudwara Sahib visit: You can visit Gurudwara which is just at a distance of 200 meters from the Monastery, We noticed that Gurudwara was under construction when we reached there on 2nd October 2020.

Kangra fort - This is located at a distance from Dorzong monastery, If you happen to travel to Palampur you must visit Kangra fort , this is a amazing fort built at a height.

This fort was built by Royal Rajput family of Kangra fort.

After visit to the fort, we went to Shri Chamunda mata mandir which is at a distance eof 25 km but when we reached there we noticed that temple got closed, so we visited the temple next day.

So we decided to stay overnight near the temple at Vatika hotel- nice hotel- we got double occupancy stay for Rs 1500 as they were offering discounts, otherwise the room tariff starts from rs 2500.

Nice play to stay, owner involvement in the hotel is high, this is located at a distance of about half a km from Shri chamunda Devi temple, overall i liked the place.

In the next episode i.e. EP 7 - you will see our journey from Shri Chamunda Devi Temple to McLeodganj.

Hope you enjoyed watching this episode.
