Hope you enjoyed this journey, this journey has taught me, whenever you find an opportunity in life to travel, grab them. and whenever you go on such adventures, you learn new things, get to know about new cultures, you meet new people & you make beautiful memories. But apart from this you also make mistakes, which later teach you lessons for life. So travel whenever you can, maybe while traveling to new places, you might find a better version of yourself & also you may achieve your own greatness.

""","The Bamboo Trail is a treacherous path in Meghalaya, India, that is said to be deadly. The trail is made up of narrow bamboo bridges that are suspended high above the ground. The bridges are often slippery and unstable, and there have been many accidents on the trail.
In this video, I hike the Bamboo Trail to see if it is really as deadly as it is said to be. I will share my experience of hiking the trail, and I will also give you some tips on how to survive if you decide to hike it yourself.

Does it feels like Scariest trek in India?
Let me know in comment section.
When you think of a trip to Meghalaya, the places you hear about are the well-known destinations.
One such place is Wahkhen and the trek to U Mawryngkhang. Some 50 km from Shillong, lies Wahkhen, a small hamlet in the interiors of East Khasi Hills.

Hi everyone.


Hope you are doing fine. I am so happy to present to you, the last episode of Spiti Travel Series which will take you to Chandrataal - The most divine and pristine lake of Spiti Valley.
Please watch previous 3 episodes of Spiti Travel Series if you have not watched them before and then watch this last episode.

 

Chandra Taal means the Lake of the Moon. The name of the lake originates from its crescent shape. It is situated at an altitude of about 4,300 metres (14,100 ft) in the Himalayas. The lake is accessible on foot from Batal as well as from Kunzum Pass from late May to early October.

 

As I was already in Spiti, I booked a cab from Kaza Taxi Union and left for Chandrataal in the morning at around 8 am. I was accompanied by my friends. We reached Chandrataal at around 2 pm. We booked our tents at Samsong Camps took rest for a while and then headed over for a 4kms trek to Chandrataal lake.

 

Watch full episode to see the awestruck travel journey which takes you to the unbelievable beautiful landscapes.



I will make a separate travel guide on how to reach Spiti and the favorable time to visit Spiti.

Till then, keep watching.
Do let me know your feedback.

Presenting to you all - Auli -The winter wonderland of Uttarakhand.
Situated at a height of 3049m, this place is no less than a winter dream. 
In this long weekend, I travelled to Auli with my friends. We were a group of 6.

Ours was a spontaneous plan and we travelled to Auli in an Ola Outstation which was the best cheapest option that we explored and moreover we were lucky to have the coolest cab driver.
We travelled in the entire night and reached Auli in the morning.

This place is best if you want to have a real experience of snow that is stretched in the entire visible land. 


You can do camping and bonfire, skiing, snow hiking, fulfill your snow fantasies and experience the cable car rides.
Auli is Surrounded by mountains on all sides.

We did camping and in the morning, went to see the artificial lake that is made in the Auli Ski Point.
We did a hike of around 1.5 kms to reach there and the 360 degrees view from atop is worth watching.


So, make your plans to Auli while it‚Äôs still winter and experience the chill of snow.
Get the real winter vibes in the Himalayas.

Hope you guys like the video.

Hey people, I went to Kasol last month, especially to shoot this vlog cause I had lost my data of the first time I was there.. But I really wanted to showcase the vibe of that beautiful Place, the way it beholds beauty, peace, freedom, purity in its air its remarkable. And I really couldn't afford to miss showcasing that out.

That's how it began, with the desire of unfurling the vibes of Kasol to the world. 

So it started with my three friends who accompanied me from Delhi.
Although the pathway was a bit messed up cause of the landslides due to the rainy climate, we somehow made it  to Kasol. And trust me we had a great great fun but my friends had to leave. 

So the very next day my travel mate, my amazing friend, Misha came by and the ultimate exploration then began.

We started travelling the place, wandering to any walkway we thought will take us to a beautiful view. As it was my second time there in Kasol but I realized that chahal had much more views to offer than I saw before. 
We discovered such amazing, beautiful spots that you're gonna see in the vlog. It's been an amazing journey shooting it, I wanted to set forth the vibes & charisma of this beautiful place in a cinematic manner which is gonna hit you to the feels. And I wanna share that this edit took about 7 days to get its trait. 

That's all I have for you, I hope you like itüòÖ

Safely did 100+ flights in all conditions.

Jaipur is the spotlight beholded by Rajasthan, highly known for it's welcoming tourism. 

The city is dear to me as it's my birth city, it's my home! 
Home is where you feel free, detached to the ordinary stereotypical stigma, be completely yourself & still feel no fear of being judged playing the abnormal, unusual & insane ""YOU"". And that's just empowering! Don't you feel empowered with the people who care about you? motivate you to break out the chains ? And set you free to a world of whole new energies.

Hi Guys,
Here is Mahabaleshwar's travel vlog  . mahabaleshwar is hill station in maharashtra , where i stayed as traveller not as a tourist for a month.

I went to a trip through myself in mahabaleshwar for a month. 
It was not my first solo trip though , I have been to north east for a solo trip.
But living in mahabaleshwar for a month , was completely different.
I sometimes found myself alone, happy , very happy , sometimes missing my friends & family.
But in this duration of a month , my bond with my dreams became more strong. .
Feedbacks are most welcome.

Hope you are doing good..
First of all i apologize for the delay in uploading 2nd episode of spiti travel vlog.. 
I am travelling from last 10 days and did not get time to edit the vlog.

But despite of the busy schedule here i present to you, second episode of one of the most magnificent places that i have been to.

We reached Spiti in the evening at around 6 pm.. As already tired we were, we dozed off as soon as we reached our hotel rooms..

Next morning we were ready to explore Kaza, kibber and chichum( chichum was not planned but turned out to be the most surprising element of the day).
This episode takes you to the roads of Spiti valley which are very smooth. We hired a bike from Himalyan Cafe which is in the main market of Kaza.. 

We went to Ki Monastery which is around 20 km from Kaza..From there, we went ahead to Kibber, another 20 km ride, had lunch at Norling Homestay, interacted with the locals and captured each and every moment with my gears nikon D810, go pro, drone, osmo and drone.

We also had an encounter with the Spiti kids who literally thrashed us with their cute little bats.. 
We flew drone and got amazing videos.

Hope you guys are enjoying the Spiti travel series.
Stay tuned for the next episode which will take you to a local cultural fest..

Here it is first travel vlog in the Spiti series.

We started our journey from Delhi in the evening, boarded a Volvo from Majnu ka Tilla. It was 15 hours long comfortable journey. Next morning, when we opened our eyes, we had reached Mandi and we were really excited to find ourselves in the fresh mountain air. We reached Manali bus stand at around 11 am.

We thought of chilling at the bus stand first, as we had found a water stream running at the back side of the bus stand known locally as khadd. I could not control myself and jumped into the water with my go pro. 

After almost 2 hours, we hired a cab from bus stand and went to mall road, where we had booked our hotel.
Then, we ahead to old Manali, the most happening place of Manali. Explored markets and some Cafes, which Old Manali is famous for.

Next morning at 7 am, we left for Spiti in a traveler. The road from Manali till Spiti is full of surprises. From vegetation to landscape everything kept on changing. 

We stopped at the famous Chacha-Chachi Chandra Dhaba for lunch at Batal. Our next stoppage was Kunzum pass. There is a temple called Kunzum Devi Temple where everyone stops to seek the blessings of Kunzum Devi. By 6 in the evening we reached Kaza.

It was already dark. We strolled around in the streets of Kaza and then dozed off 

This was episode 1. Stay tuned for the 2nd episode of Spiti- Magical Exploration which will be  about Kaza, Ki and Kibber.

first of all thank you for your love & support .
Here is Mahabaleshwar's travel vlog  . mahabaleshwar is hill station in maharashtra , where i stayed as traveller not as a tourist for a month.

I went to a trip through myself in mahabaleshwar for a month. 
It was not my first solo trip though , I have been to north east for a solo trip.
But living in mahabaleshwar for a month , was completely different.
I sometimes found myself alone, happy , very happy , sometimes missing my friends & family.
But in this duration of a month , my bond with my dreams became more strong. .
Feedbacks are most welcome.
