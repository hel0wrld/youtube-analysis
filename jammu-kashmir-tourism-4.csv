As promised, this video includes newly constructed bridges as well as the ones that didn’t feature in the previous year’s version.

A brief overview:
Srinagar is also known as the Venice of the East. River Jhelum is an integral part of the old city of Srinagar. Nine bridges span the River Jhelum, and many tiny ones intersect the network of waterways that flow through the old city. These nine bridges are Zero Bridge, Amira Kadal, Budshah Kadal, Habba Kadal, Fateh Kadal, Zaina Kadal, Aali Kadal, Nawa Kadal and Safa Kadal, ‘Kadal’ being the Kashmiri word for bridge. Of these Budshah Bridge and Zero Bridge are the newest; the former having been constructed by the British in this century. Presently, the oldest bridge is Fateh Kadal, too dilapidated for actual use. However, many of the old bridges have been replaced with new concrete bridges and a few new ones have also been added in view of the increasing traffic. The most prominent among these is the Abdullah Bridge, situated near the Tourist Reception Centre.

The view from any of the old city's bridges is wholly and unmistakably Kashmiri. Old brick buildings line the banks. The distinctive pagoda-like roof of a mosque or a shrine enlivens the horizon, and in the muddy water of the River Jhelum, a straggling row of doongas flanks the edges. These boats, with their shingled roofs, are the forerunners of Srinagar’s houseboat. A particular community lives in them. Formerly this community was associated with ferrying people, livestock and food grains along the river. The past still lingers in their lifestyles even if their occupation has changed. Occasionally one may catch sight of a doonga making its stately progress down the river as the owner shifts residence. Doongas are sparsely furnished - virtually no furniture is seen except for the kitchen, which gleams with copper utensils of every description that line the shelves from floor to ceiling.",137291,2546,390

Copper has been an integral part of Kashmiri households.  The old city abounds with shops where objects of copper line the walls, the floor and even the ceiling, made generally for the local market. Craftsmen can often be seen engraving objects of household utility - samovars, bowls, plates and trays. Floral, stylised, geometric, leaf and sometimes calligraphic motifs are engraved or embossed on copper and occasionally silver, to cover the entire surface with intricate designs which are then oxidised, so as to stand out better from the background. The work, known as 'naqashi', determines the price of the object, as does the weight.

The process of making copper utensils:
The process of making of a copper or brassware goes through many copper artisans as initially coppersmith (Thanthur) shapes the raw metal into a soft object and while he finishes his work the further process of the making copper utensils and showpieces, then soft objects goes to a calligraphic artist (Naaqash) who carve the pattern and designs that copper object.
When calligraphic artists job is done the objects or a copper utensil is being sent to copper cleaner ‘Charakgar’ who clean the jagged ends and finishes the product before it goes for coating process by Kalai-Saz.
The most general pattern used on copperware is of maple leaf (Chinar) Almonds (Badam) and other Mughal blots.

VERINAG
Located at the foothill of picturesque Pir Panjal mountain range, Verinag is a major tourist attraction in south Kashmir’s Anantnag district. It is situated 26 km south of Anantnag and 78 km from Srinagar. It lies just below the entry point of Kashmir Valley after crossing Jawahar Tunnel. With an average elevation of 1,851 m (6,076 ft), Verinag is famous for its spring and a garden. The Verinag Spring is named after Nila Nag, the son of the famous Hindu sage Kashyap Rishi, to whom, goes the credit of establishing the territory of Jammu and Kashmir. There is an octagonal stone basin at Verinag Spring and an arcade surrounding it which was built by Mughal emperor Jahangir in 1620 A.D. Next to this spring, a beautiful garden was laid out by his son Shah Jahan. This spring is also the major source of river Jhelum that flows through the entire Valley from south to north before crossing over to Pakistan.
Verinag spring is situated at the bottom of a hill covered by pine trees and evergreen plants. It was originally an irregular and shapeless pond forming a little marsh. After seeing the dilapidated condition of the spring and its scattered waters, Jahangir’s artistic taste for polishing the beauty of nature could not tolerate the eye- soaring spectacle and he determined to improve it. He built the octagonal tank of sculptured stones round it, so that all water was collected therein, for which carvers were brought from Iran. Seven years later, Shah Jahan, constructed a garden in front of the spring with cascades and aqueducts in straight lines through and around the fine garden.

INTERESTING FACTS:
The water contained in the octagonal spring has crystal blue water teeming with fish. Verinag Spring and Mughal Arcade surrounding it is officially recognized by Archaeological Survey of India as a Monument of National Importance. It is considered as the best picnic spot in south Kashmir for its being easily accessible by road transport. The garden is open for visitors round the year. However, to be here in the spring, summer and autumn has its own charm. With every season the garden changes colours as the seasonal flowers, bedecking its flower beds get changes and so does the ambience and the hues. Likewise, the majestic Chinar trees turn red in the autumn, lending a riot of colour to the landscape. Verinag spring has a big market starting just from its gates. So, visitors will not face any sort of trouble here. A day’s visit is easily manageable to this lovely place.

Paper mache is one of the most beautiful handicrafts of Kashmir. There are a variety of items prepared by the craftsmen of Kashmir which have beautiful designs and colours and include pen stands, coasters, jewellery boxes, flower vases, lamp shades, trays, photo frames and decorative bowls""

The process of making a paper cache prioduct involves two simple procedures- Sakhtsazi and Naqashi. 
Sakhtsazi involves fashioning the base product from the pulp of paper into the desired form while Naqashi is the painting process done over it.

To make a paper mache object, paper is usually soaked, pulped and pasted layer by layer over a mould. A mixture of chalk and glue is then pasted upon. The whole mixture upon drying is painted in different and delicate motifs and designs with beautiful colours. The result is a delicate and classic piece of paper mache object. This craft requires great degree of skill, training and practice. Kashmiri Paper mache is a handicraft of Kashmir that was brought from Persia in the 15th century. It is based primarily on paper pulp, and is a richly decorated, colourful artifact generally in the form of vases, bowls, or cups (with and without metal rims), boxes, trays, bases of lamps, and many other small objects.

These are made in homes, and workshops in Srinagar, and other parts of the Kashmir Valley and then are marketed, although there is a significant international market for these products. The product is protected under the Geographic Indication Act 1999 of Government of India, and was registered by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks during the period from April 2011 to March 2012 under the title ""Kashmir Paper Mache”.

Carved walnut wood-work is among the most important crafts of Kashmir. Kashmir is now one of the few places in the world where walnut is still available at an altitude of 5500-7500 feet above see level. The wood is hard and durable, its close grain and even texture facilitating fine and detailed work. It also presents visually interesting effects with mere plain polished surfaces in fact in contemporary products, plain surfaces and small carvings are preferred, especially on trays, tables, bowls and similar items.
The Kashmir craftsman, however, rejoices in carving intricate and varied designs. A variety of carved products bear recurrent motifs of the rose, lotus, iris, bunches of grapes, pears and chinar leaves. Dragon motifs and patterns taken from kani and embroidered shawls all find their place in wooden objects with deep relief carving. A variety of articles, both decorative and utilitarian, ranging from small items like bowls, trays, cigarette boxes, wall plaques and table lamps to screens, bedsteads and larger items of furniture are carved in walnut wood. Four main types of carving are usually practised in Kashmir-raised, engraved, undercut and plain. The carving of furniture and smaller items is an elaborate process and involves high degree of skill and craftsmanship. The carving is done with the help of small indigenous tools. The art of wood carving is centred in the city of Srinagar.

Another 300-year-old collection Tafseer-e-Muvahib is the commentary on Holy Quran from Surah Fatiah to Surah Naas. The peculiarity of this manuscript is that it has been purchased in Kabul in 3 Tumans of Afghan currency approximately Rs 7 of Indian currency. The commentary is written in Naskh style, and the manuscript has been calligraphed in Afghan.
One of them is ‘Majooma-Ilm-Ikhlaq’, which is a nicely written manuscript in the Persian language in 1882 AD.

Another type of manuscript is ‘Sad Pand Luqman’ of Hakim Luqman, which is a Persian manuscript scribed by Peer Baksh of Punjab in Khate Nakhoon on ethics.

This manuscript written in 1870 AD is specially ornamented with gold and the borders are decorated with pictures of animals and birds.

Most of these manuscripts and calligraphic works have been written on sheep, goat or camel vellum collected by the royal jewelers of Maharaja Hari Singh.

Please note that this exhibition at TRC Srinagar will run till 11th of June and the entry is free to all.
