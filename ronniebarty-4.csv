This tunnel will give year round access to the otherwise inaccessible Lahaul Valley, which remains shut during the long winters. 

At the moment the future seems bright, yet uncertain. There is no doubt that Lahaul can develop into a world class winter sports destination - we just need a champion to spearhead things.

We are back on the road again and this time we are heading to the remote valley of Zanskar. Starting from where we left off in Soul Trails - Shinkula Pass, we venture into Zanskar from the Southern end on the new road that connects Himachal Pradesh to the newly formed Union Territory of Ladakh. This road is a playground for anyone who loves to off-road, presenting all sorts of challenges from crazy river crossings to manoeuvring sharp scree covered hairpin bends. But all that intense driving is totally worth it when you stop for a moment and look out your window at the jaw-dropping landscape. 
Our first stop is Village Kargyak where we will be camping the night.

Winter is finally here! The Atal Tunnel works like a magic portal that transports you to the winter wonderland that is Lahaul. This is our first time experiencing Lahaul in all it's icy glory - and we absolutely love it! Hiking in knee deep snow to the frozen Sissu Waterfalls, stopping for a quick coffee along the way, driving into the sunset as the world freezes over and the only way to make it through the night - spend it in a mud house! The same home we helped renovate back in April is now ready and open for visitors! It's called ""Zomsa"" which means 'a gathering' in Tibetan. If you wanna experience some sub zero living definitely make your way to Lahaul!

It is perfect for the explorer within us as it is made using scratch resistant plasma ceramic, has a power reserve of 80 hours and is water resistant up to 300 meters. The Rado Centrix Automatic reflects a timeless design and showcases the perfection that it stands for.

We've come back to the spellbinding Spiti Valley for the third time after almost 7 years. And even after all this time this valley left us feeling completely gobsmacked! We wanted to get a glimpse of the very elusive Snow Leopard, and were lucky enough to spot 3 of them -  a mother and two cubs, on our very first day in Spiti! The Himachal Pradesh Ice Hockey teams were gearing up to leave for Ladakh to compete in the National Championships. We got to hang out with them for a while before they left and tried out ice skating for the first time ever.

This is the last leg of our journey in Ladakh and this time around we are exploring Lower Sham Valley and parts of Kargil District. We start off by checking out 1000 year cave paintings at Saspol, then we make a quick stop at Domkhar to see ancient rock carvings known as Petroglyphs, before finally stopping at Skurbuchan to explore the castle and the monastery. 
We then head to the very famous Aryan Valley to a village called Garkon and finally to probably our best find of this trip - a village tucked away on the Srinagar-Leh highway called Bodhkharbu.

Driving further North through some of the most scenic villages, we head up to Padum - the heart of Zanskar. We explore the main market - eating at restaurants, shopping for essentials - it's a sudden boom of city life after being in isolation for the past few days. Then we go check out some local attractions - the waterfall in Sheela Village and an ancient rock carving site called Gyalwa Ringna. And finally we head to Photang - H.H. The Dalai Lama's Residence in Zanskar where we get to witness a historical homecoming.

The highlight of our trip was definitely the Zostel Homestay that we stayed at hosted by the warmest father and son - Joginder and Nomit Thakur. We feasted on some delicious Himachali home cooked meals.

2022 has started of with some epic snowgasms!! All through January we've had snow storms constantly white-washing the landscape. One of our favourite things to do when it snows is to go for a long walk in the town forest, followed by a scrumptious feast at one of our favourite restaurants - The Corner House.
Once again we make our way across the Atal Tunnel to the gorgeous Lahaul Valley to celebrate their New Year called Halda. A very big thank you to Zangpo Ji and family and the super awesome team at Zomsa for inviting us into their homes and letting us experience something so magical!

It's Spring time and that can mean only one thing - it's time to pull out our hiking boots and head out into the mountains - happiness! üòä
We are in Fojal Valley -  a sub-valley that cuts off from the Kullu-Manali highway. We're staying the weekend in Dhara Village at a friend's heritage kath-kuni style home, which is the start point for a hike to the hidden village of Parbi. Through forests and meadows and steep hill sides, we make it across the ridge to finally reach the secret hamlet of Parbi. It's unbelievable that a village like this still exists in Kullu Valley in 2022! Still no road... and maybe that's why it's somewhat frozen in time.

Spring is around the corner and it's time to put on our hiking shoes! We've never really been hiking around Kullu town before, and a lot of our subscribers recommended that we go to Kais Dhar for a day hike. And man was it spectacular! The trail starts from Lot Village, about a 20km drive from Mohal, Kullu. The trail leading to Kais Dhar is one of the easiest we've done so far but still high on rewards. Further up from the famous ridge, atop the peak are the ruins of an old fort at Chamba Garh. We made it to the top but sadly couldn't experience the panoramic views as the clouds shrouded the horizon and it started hailing down on us.

We go to the highest point in Bangkok, atop the gigantic Mahanakhon Tower and are gobsmacked by the magnificent cityscape. Then we head to the Jodd Fairs Night Market for some retail therapy and pig out on some Volcano Ribs or Leng Saap at the very famous Diaw Maekhlong Restaurant. 
The iconic Wat Pho and Wat Arun temples leave us utterly speechless! And you can't escape the mall scene while you're in Bangkok. From budget buys to luxury brands, from fine dining to michelin star street food - you can find it all!

No trip to Banjar is complete without heading up to Shoja and Jalori Pass. We hike up to the beautiful Serolsar Lake, witness one of the most spectacular sunsets in the mountains and even woke up the season's first snowfall! ‚ùÑÔ∏è

We‚Äôve both often fantasised about building our own Earthship one day - a completely self sustaining home made out of natural / reclaimed materials, living off the grid and a home that we wish to build with our own hands. 
We found out about this ‚ÄúMud House Renovation Workshop‚Äù that is being conducted by an NGO called LAHOL based in Keylong and thought that this would be a great starting point for us to learn about building with natural materials. We‚Äôll be doing some hands on mud plastering work and learning about traditional building techniques from the local village women.

Bangkok has something on offer for everyone. You can immerse yourself in the rich Thai heritage and culture, get inspired by the really cool street art, fly into the future and be completely dazzled by the neon lights! 
We really wanted to explore the very famous Chinatown in Bangkok and relish the mad, mad food available out there. Being there is an absolute sensory overload!
We then headed south east from Bangkok to the province of Samut Prakan to visit the largest outdoor exhibition in the world at Ancient City. This place left us in absolute awe!

Our first Thai island - the biggest one - Phuket. Man did this island live up to it's reputation and left us wanting to go back for more! We went for our first ever Muay Thai Fight at the Patong Boxing Stadium - one of the most adrenaline pumping experiences we've had! We decided to stay in the gorgeous Old Town area of Phuket instead of the more popular beach towns of Patong or Karon. The Sunday Night Market in Old Town was probably one of the best markets we went to in all of Thailand. On our final day we rode up to the very famous Big Buddha, and down to the southern tip of the island to Black Rock Viewpoint.

The high altitude takes it toll on me, but I try and push myself to new limits. Also having Pintu and Arun along - who are probably the best backcountry skiers/boarders in India, motivated me to put in maximum effort.
