In winter, avid birders and ornithologists flock to the park to observe and study the feathered beauties. With more than 370 recorded species, KNP used to also host the Siberian crane. It is a World Heritage Site.

In some form or the other, it is celebrated all over Rajasthan. “Gan” is a synonym for Lord Shiva & “Gauri” or “Gaur” stands for Goddess Parvati, the heavenly consort of Lord Shiva. Gangaur celebrates the union of the two and is a symbol of conjugal & marital happiness. Gangaur is celebrated in the month of Chaitra (March-April), the first month of the Hindu calendar. This month marks the end of winter & the onset of spring. This festival is celebrated especially by women, who worship clay idols of “Gan” & “Gauri” in their houses. These idols are worshipped by unmarried girls who seek the blessings of Gan & Gauri for a good husband, while the married women pray for the good health and long life of their husbands. This worship which starts from the first day of the chaitra month culminates on the 18th day into Gangaur festival with a great religious fervor.

It was created in mid 18th century as a small reservoir located 5 kilometres to the southeast of Bharatpur. The construction of the Ajan Bund (dam) and the subsequent flooding of this natural depression led to one of the world’s most fascinating and spectacular bird reserves. The Keoladeo Ghana National Park is considered to be one of the richest bird areas in the world today.

The festival is mainly for women, and includes dancing, singing, getting together with friends and narrating stories, applying henna on hands and feet, wearing brightly coloured lehariya saris, sharing festive foods and playing under trees on swings on Haryali Teej. The festivals are dedicated, in many parts of India, to Goddess Parvati, also known as Teej Mata. Women pray to the goddess seeking the wellness of their husband. On this occassion, a royal procession of Goddess Teej comprising of camels, dancing folk artists, royal palanquins, chariots and bullock carts, starts from the City Palace, winding its way through Tripolia Bazaar and Chhoti Chaupar on both days. The traditional sweet Ghewar is closely associated with the festival and enjoyed heartily over its duration.

It is dominated by Bhil tribals (popularly known as the bowmen of Rajasthan) who make up more than half the total population of the region. History states that Banswara was ruled by a Bhil ruler named Bansia or Wasna and the place derived its name from him. Bansai was defeated by Jagmal Singh who crowned himself Banswara’s first Maharaval.

The district is a mix of different geographies with fertile plains of maize, wheat, rice, cotton soya bean and gram covering the entire central and western regions, while the Aravallis range makes up the eastern side. The rich teak forests and mango, khajur (date) and mahua trees are home to diverse wildlife. The archaeological significance of Arthuna has made it one of the prime attractions of Banswara.
